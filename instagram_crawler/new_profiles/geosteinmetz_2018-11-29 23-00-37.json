Grapes were first planted here by the Romans, and ancient stone walls help to keep the soil in place. If you pinch and zoom on the left you can see the new motorized monorail built to carry the grapes down to the road over 300 ft. below.

The harvest is floated to shore on small rafts and then dried for export, to be used as an emulsifier in various products. While sunlight and clear water are abundant in the Central Pacific, transportation is not. There are no scheduled flights to this remote atoll, and I had to charter a tri-maran for the two day trip to get here. #sustainability in agriculture is complicated, and will be part of my discussion today in Milan for the @BCFNFoundation",
