She cares for her mentally unstable mother Astrid, as well as for her younger brother, Bo. Astrid\u2019s volatile behavior has\ncaused the two children to constantly walk a tightrope in order to avoid anything that can trigger their mother\u2019s outbreaks.\nThings seem to look up when Astrid lands a job interview and Jill works hard to support her mother and boost her self-esteem. The news that their\nestranged father, Nils, will be visiting on Jill\u2019s 14th birthday, gives the children with much needed hope. But the small family is stricken by a tragedy. In shock, Jill decides to bury the truth.\nAt first it seems that Nils\u2019 arrival will solve everything. The whirlwind of excitement Nils creates is the perfect antidote to what Jill has just gone through/experienced. Her dream of a glamorous life together with their father,\nnow becomes a matter of survival for herself and her young brother.",
