I recently got the chance to revisit it again during a stop with @norwegiancruiseline . It hasn\u2018t changed much, the tower is still there, still leaning and it\u2018s still fun, especially to watch all the tourists doing funny poses. But there is more than just the leaning tower. The whole Piazza dei Miracoli (Square of wonders) with the Catherdrale and the biggest Baptistery in the world is actually amazing. As you can see, even the Baptistery is slightly leaning.\n.\n#ad #norwegianepic #ncl"
