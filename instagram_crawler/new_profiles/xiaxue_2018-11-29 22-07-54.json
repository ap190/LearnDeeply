He had so much fun!! \ud83d\ude0d The moment we got in he was running about exploring the whole two storeys of activities - and the place is HUGE!!!!!!\n\u2800\nIt's Singapore\u2019s first indoor activity park and I like that it's catered for family fun, so I was able to join in whatever Dash set his eyes on. All mommies will know that most indoor playgrounds are catered for only the kids, which means the adults are usually just standing around watching the children play. But at @superparksg the adults can have fun too - even if they don\u2019t have a kid with them \ud83d\ude06\n\nIt's now open to public at Suntec. We didn't get to try all the activities cos there's just too many, but can't wait to get back there again \u263a\ufe0f Best thing is that it\u2019s all indoors so it\u2019s nicely air-conditioned and you can go rain or shine! I'll be releasing a video soon so watch out for it \ud83d\ude1a\n\u2800\n#superpark #sp #singapore #indoorplayground"
