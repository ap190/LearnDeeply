Because of this, I've finally achieved some goals of mine such as finally performing on stage, creating larger scale works, wearing looks out and about and I owe it all to the perspective I gained from this self-reflection (which ask any of my friends and it is all I talk about)! Lucky for me, @nab asked me to create this work inspired by their Talk to Yourself Experience, an online tool which creates a visual portrait of yourself based on different words you type or say verbally! They want people to take time to discover what they want most from their life because when you know what you really want, that\u2019s when they can really help you get there and, in this case, visualise it! So my portrait has hearts, lightbulbs, and crayons because I want to keep working roles that I love but also to push new ideas and be as creative as possible! Which creating this has really helped in doing!\n\nSo check out the tool if you want to work out what you want and try something fun!\nHope you are all well! #spon"

Thanks to my friends that did come, I'm so glad I finally broke the performance seal so thanks to John and Stevie for letting me occupy the stage that most of peers have done before!\n\nAnyway, I did a lip sync to my pal @washingtongram song Rich Kids, which everyone said was s very me thing to do. So if anyone wants to see at least clips of it, let me know and I can harass my friends for what they recorded!\nAnyway, I'm hoping to do more full looks more often now so let me know if you like them!\n\nHope everyone's weekend is going well."

If you bite off each end and use it like a straw with milk or any other beverage, its called a Tim Tam Slam! So given the opportunity, I got to make a giant crochet version of a #TimTamSlam!\n\nSo the guys over at @arnottsbiscuits and @timtam are encouraging people to #sharetheslam (like I will for @petschack @patrickhsds and @ihateprozac ) #collab\nAnyway, I hope everyone is well!"

So like I said the other day super excited to reveal (no pun intended) this ramen bowl dress!\n\n@uniqloau has a large range of Uniqlo graphic t-shirts to help express who you are, how you feel and there is always a constant update of new collections for you to try! So I figured what else to pair with the new ramen noodle collection t-shirts than a ramen dress inspired by the design on the shirt itself! I really liked how colorful it was and how I could translate it to a new reversible artwork!\n\nAnyway, I hope everyone really likes it, I like how it turned out!\n\n#ad #uniqloau"

I know a lot of you didn't recognize what I was crocheting this whole time, but hopefully it makes more sense now!\n\nHopefully you all like it, I've also recorded twice for a YouTube video but I haven't liked what I made so I'm gonna re record again tomorrow and hopefully have a video up on the weekend!\n\nAnyway you'll see a bit more soon!\nHope y'all are well x"

I've always wanted to do a fried chicken leg, especially after I had made the first one many years ago! Though lucky for someone will be able to buy this one for themselves! Who wouldn\u2019t want an Original Recipe hat. You can buy it on the link I'll put in my bio tomorrow at 12pm!\n\n#sp #webackyouth @kfcaustralia"
