Thank you for being engaged ocean advocates driving transformational solutions for healthy and abundant oceans. It takes a strong, global community to achieve conservation wins and I'm excited to keep connecting with like-minded organizations and individuals who believe in the power of media to inspire real change. Without The Tide - a passionate community giving whatever they can, month after month - none of what we do at @SeaLegacy would be possible. There's a lot more work to be done, especially around the protection of the Antarctic in the upcoming year, which is why we are aiming to grow The Tide by 1000 new members today on #GivingTuesday. #Follow @SeaLegacy's stories all day and invite your family, friends, and fellow ocean lovers to #RaiseTheTide with us."

Now, I mostly shoot video which is a much more peaceful experience for all of us. Perhaps they thought that this was my attempt at echolocation. This encounter was completely on their terms and they left the scene as calmly as they entered it. For so many photograhers, once they get a sharp, well exposed image their job is done. As conservation photographers our job is just beginning and now it is time for these visuals to go to work and give these orcas and their habitat a voice. #imageswithpurpose #gratitude #nature #wildlife #orca"

There were stunned herring everywhere and I gambled by parking myself next to one of them. The orca slowly and calmly approached the herring and gingerly grasped it, decapitated it and ate the body. We are just on our way home from #Norway and one of the great joys is to review images and footage from the past three expeditions. Two things are abundantly clear from this latest expedition. Oil drilling in a place where orcas come to feed must not happen. Secondly, as the world falls in love with these orcas, there needs to be much tighter controls on whale watching tourism. We had a scientist on board monitoring our own interactions and she was horrified by the number of boats and operators who showed an absolute lack of respect for these animals. Some companies do it right and others do not. This should not be a free-for-all.

Polar bears are masters at conserving energy. At this stage, these cubs are drinking milk that has 33% fat content compared to humans at 3-5%. The mother needs to catch seals on a regular basis for survival and energy conversion for her young. According to scientists polar bears will not survive without sea ice.

Is it because they are they are the leaders their pods?

All orcas have echolocation beneath the waves but must use their eyes to assess their surroundings above water.

While this collection of twenty books definitely skews toward my own tastes and interests, I feel good about my top pick: Paul Nicklen's Born to Ice... a collection of photographs from his travels to both of this planet's poles, and the result is massive\u2014both literally and figuratively... the book is a treasure for naturalists, photography geeks, and armchair adventurers alike.\" Thanks for your kind words Jon Foro!!

It took years of political negotiation, applications, and approvals to arrive at this beautiful moment in time: this white seascape, painted with the shadows of resilient and powerful emperor penguins, was finally a marine protected area. That was back in 2016. Much more of the Antarctic needs the same protection. But the 2018 Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (#CCAMLR) saw politics overrule science and resulted in no further protection of this beautiful place. I hope you will support us as we increase our efforts to safeguard #Antarctica."

I was hiking through the tall grass on South Georgia, Antarctica to go and photograph wandering albatross when this seal came charging out at me. I apologized for the intrusion, tried to not be insensitive by laughing out loud and carried on my way. Images like this would never make my fine art book #borntoice but the memories are fresh and vivid. May that never change. #gratitude #nature #antarctica #adventure #explore"

I never realized that Instagram would connect me to such a beautiful, engaged and passionate group of people. You give us the energy to stay in the fight to speak out on behalf of wildlife and their ecosystems. I am grateful for our incredible @sealegacy team of 22 passionate individuals who stay behind from expeditions and do the heavy-lifting on campaigns, solutions and editing. I am grateful for @cristinamittermeier who is the most passionate conservationist I know. I am grateful to all of the wildlife who have allowed me a glimpse into their secretive worlds. We have a lot of work ahead of us and we are going to keep having conservation wins with @sealegacy. Please get behind us and join us on www.sealegacy.org #turningthetide. #gratitude. Picture of me as a biologist from 25 years ago holding a Canadian lynx that is waking up from its sedative. Science is important but if there is any hope in saving this ailing Earth then that is only going to happen with visual story-telling and passionate people such as yourselves. \ud83d\ude4f"
