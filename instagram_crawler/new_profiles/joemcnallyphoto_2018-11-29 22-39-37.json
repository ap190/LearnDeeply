Have worked with Amber numerous times, and I always hope one of these days we will work together on a dedicated shoot, and not just do quick onstage portraiture. She is a wonder in front of the lens. Lighting grid here is all #speedlights, classic, familiar over and under pattern. Main above, fill below, running at about minus one EV relative to the value of the main. Beauty of this arrangement is that they are both the Ezybox Speed-Lite 2 Plus soft boxes I helped design along with @lastolitebymanfrotto. Both of these can simply stuff into your bag--extremely portable. Shot at 1/4000 at f1.4. Good solution to drop out the crowd standing behind Amber. @the photography show. #TransformationTuesday #TuesdayThoughts #TipTuesday\n#TravelTuesday #TopicTuesday #portraitoftheday  #portraitphotography  #NikonAmbassador #UKNikon #D5",

About 30,000 to 40,000 watt seconds of flash. First into umbrellas then through 20x20 silks. How to get their attention? One musician brought his instrument and when I shouted \u201cHit it!\u201d He started to play.

Daughter of a sharecropper, she grew up to be a wonderful educator, spending over two decades teaching in the @nyc school system. She was a formidable force educating young people everywhere she went, but in particular, she was an amazing and positive role model for young girls. Sadly, she just passed away, but she lived a life that is revered. Her namesake school in Wilson, NC, The Sallie B. Howard School for the Arts and Education, continues to keep her legacy alive, educating and shaping the lives of young people. One of the truly beautiful things about being a photog is to meet people like Sallie, who was a beacon to young girls and boys, and a joy to be around.  @educator #education #teachers #ThursdayVibes #ThursdayMotivation #ThankfulThursday #picoftheday #portraitphotography #NikonAmbassador",

I texted Frank the next day, \u201cShe said yes!\u201d This bar is on the West Coast of Ireland, and it had a dark wall in between two windows, one big, one small.

Candice, as always, made my job easy by working with the camera in such a wonderful and fluid way. Three foot Octa with a fabric grid. Previous frame had too much light on her hip, so I simply moved the light higher. Beauty of the grid, it limits the spill, concentrates the light on her face, and naturally gradates to dark tones in the lower part of the frame.  #motivationalmonday  #MondayMood #MondayMemories #PPEWorkshop\n#portaitoftheday #picoftheday #fashion\n#portraitphotography #NYC @NikonUSA #NikonAmbassador #D5",
