Last evening we walked back from the Golden Temple in Amritsar to our simple hotel in the heart of this holy city. Across the street from the entrance was a glowing blue, a color beyond the light spectrum only seen in recent years, light so liquid it pours. Walking over briefly, I peeked into the rear opening of the LED lit rickshaw and asked the man if I could take is portrait. Bemused by my curiosity, he twisted gently in his seat, rested his arms and smiled, with his eyes. Strangely, there was no other light behind me. I thanked him after taking a few photos, crossing the street into the hotel. While in my room, I looked on this camera\u2019s large glowing screen seeing something I hadn\u2019t noticed in our brief moment together...pinch into this image, the eyes, seeing a most mystical twinkle, his smile glowing within.\n#onassignment @natgeo @outofedenwalk @natgeoimagecollection #india #amritsar #portrait #blue #electricblue #eyes"

And thank you so much for all the private messages so many of you send each day. Yes, I would love to meet everyone throughout this month long assignment in northern India, and to be honest, there simply isn\u2019t time.
