Everything looks different with a winter coat on, which can make for vastly different photos than you would get in the same locations during summer \ud83d\udcf8\n-\nOne of the main questions that I\u2019m asked is whether I\u2019m bothered by the cold! As long as you\u2019re prepared to be out in the elements, you will have a great time shooting the landscape of Iceland during winter. In addition to waterproof clothing, be prepared to have a warm woollen hat, gloves, and even to double-sock once in a while! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udde6\n-\nAre you ready for the adventure of a lifetime in Iceland? \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\udcf8 Check out our range of winter photography workshops at the LINK IN MY BIO.\n-\n\ud83c\udf20 MORE INFO: https://iceland-photo-tours.com\n-\n#iceland #guidetoiceland #MyStopover"

Looming over a gorgeous black sand beach with waves drifting in from the Atlantic Ocean, it makes for a beautiful backdrop in landscape photography \ud83d\udcf8\n-\nWith dramatic peaks reaching 454 metres into the sky, Vestrahorn stands out on the windswept Stokksnes Peninsula, particularly with a light dusting of snow at the beginning of winter. Once the snowfall takes hold during the crux of winter, the black sand becomes covered in a layer of white, making for truly enchanting scenes \u2744\ufe0f\n-\nPractice your landscape photography and learn all there is to know about Iceland in winter! \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\udcf8 Check out our range of winter photography workshops at the LINK IN MY BIO.\n-\n\ud83c\udf20 MORE INFO: https://iceland-photo-tours.com\n-\n#iceland #guidetoiceland #MyStopover"
