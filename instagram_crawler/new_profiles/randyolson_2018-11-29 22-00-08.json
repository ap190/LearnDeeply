In a spontaneous Holiday flash sale, I am offering this signed print for purchase for $100 for ten days only. Click the link in my bio to purchase.\nThe Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser, taking a bath in his makeshift tub in the native forest of New Zealand. Next month he would have been 90 years old.\nAs a young photographer in 1978, I had been asked to submit my portfolio to photograph Hundertwasser in New Zealand for a book project. As I was competing with the legendary Ernst Haas and one of my idols since college, Thomas H\u00f6pker, I did not expect to stand a chance \u2013 but I was chosen.\nSo I spent a couple of weeks with Hundertwasser at his rugged and remote property on the northeastern tip of New Zealand. Hundertwasser had a wicked kind of humor. To be allowed to take this photograph, I had to promise that I would bathe after him \u2013 without changing the water. Which I did \u2013 but it was definitely one of the shortest baths I ever took.\nFriedensreich Regentag Dunkelbunt Hundertwasser (1928\u20132000) was a world-renowned eccentric artist, architect and early environmentalist. He designed houses with grass roofs, undulating floors, and onion-shaped domes. In his art and architecture he used bright colors and organic forms, was fascinated by spirals, and considered straight lines as \u2018immoral and godless\u2019. For this flash sale the photograph is printed on an archival 8.5x11 inch Legacy Platine paper with an actual image size of 6x9 inch. It is signed with an archival marker on the front border. Large limited edition prints of this image are in several private collections.\nThe flash sale ends on December 4th. All prints are shipped via USPS priority mail.\nGo to link in the bio @gerdludwig to purchase the print.\n@thephotosociety #Hundertwasser #artist #Newzealand #flashsale",

You will feel compelled to choose, but you cannot wade across: the water is too deep. And you should not swim: there are too many crocs. Please also do not leave your baggage, for we promise it will vanish before your return. So, what will you do? If you have been around a little while, you understand the joke. There is the boat, or nothing. No one remembers how it got here; possibly an Italian came this far up the Omo and abandoned it. Or a Belgian went downriver and then one night disappeared into the bush. Whatever, the boat is old and unreliable. Some days it runs, some days it doesn\u2019t, one day it\u2019s here and the next it\u2019s gone. We recommend that you don\u2019t bother crossing. Drive on as far as you can, or, better, start walking. You will encounter great oxbows that swallow half a day\u2019s journey, and enormous mosquitoes and herds of wary cattle armed with great horns to fend off lions. This photograph is our way of telling you that really it doesn\u2019t matter which side you're on. Consider the message of geometry\u2014the frond in the boy\u2019s hand, the wake of the boat behind him. Coming or going, upriver or down, patterns calmly repeating. When the boy asks what you are doing here, tell him you just wanted to see if what you\u2019d heard was true.\n\u2014\nWater. It runs through all of our work. In every story, every photograph, water is present\u2014or by its absence still leaves a mark. This series is an exploration of ideas and places that are connected by water, and the ways our lives, memories and work have been shaped by it. Join us @randyolson & @neilshea13 for the journey.\n\u2014\n#ethiopia #omoriver #suri #mursi #nyangatom #kara #africaslastfrontier #crossings #rivercrossing #geometry #rivers #borders #portraits #wetseason #watershedstories #adryseason @natgeocreative @thephotosociety",

Twenty percent of our food and 40 percent of our beef rely on the aquifer. It\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019ve pumped the equivalent of two Lake Eries out, setting the stage for a new desert in the Texas panhandle and southern Kansas in the immediate future.\n\nThe aquifer recharges at different rates. Nebraska wins the water lottery; it is the only place you can see Ogallala water at the surface. The Ogallala takes a long time to recharge in Texas, where there are the most wells, the least regulation, the hottest temperatures (even before climate change), and the slowest recharge. Entire communities in this area are already running out of water.\n\nScarcity of water, fragile infrastructure, small dust bowls, the family farm crisis, Big Ag, and global urbanization leave some behind with few options. Small towns are disintegrating around their residents. There is rampant meth and opioid addiction in some of these places. If your hot water heater breaks, there isn\u2019t anyone in your entire county that can fix it.\n\nI am from the Midwest, and the pain rural folks have gone through showed up this election. I saw this frustration first-hand working on the Ogallala aquifer story that ran in the August 2016 issue of National Geographic, but I never thought the level of frustration of these communities would manifest itself in this way. @natgeo @natgeocreative @thephotosociety",

And then you pull in the spear and push the fish down the line, far down and away, as though you didn\u2019t even want him. This is important, because on the reef there are many sharks. If you are a good fisherman, you\u2019ll spear a lot. If you are a good shot, you\u2019ll end up with many fish trailing behind you through the sea. If you have pierced them well there won\u2019t be much blood but they are still moving, wriggling, fighting against the rope, and this is what attracts the big sharks. Imagine it. You are swimming around tugging along a line of bait, and in this line you are the biggest prize! So, you keep pushing the fish down and away. This is what the most experienced men learn. Maybe it's why they are still alive. If the shark comes he may take one, two, three, but let him. Better to be hungry than dead.\n\u2014\nWater. It runs through all of our work.

The ship\u2019s engines groaned, and at the waterline there was a slither of steel and plastic as the line went tight. The ice had become troublesome. Yes it was enormous, but it was also free, and that is a condition never tolerated long. On its slow wander through the North Atlantic the iceberg had come to threaten an oil platform called Hibernia, which sits a few hundred miles from the spot where, in 1912, the Titanic sank. A century later, everyone concerned wanted to avoid another wreck and so the berg was lassoed and tugged away. It takes a lot to budge the big ones, but just a few degrees will do to spare disaster. Look at those blues, all the colors of cold, and imagine the slow dissolve ahead. How long did this one last? They say such ice is a memory from the past, from the old earth, and like everything remembered it grows and shrinks and shapes itself until it falls apart.\n\u2014\nWater. It runs through all of our work. In every story, every photograph, water is present\u2014or by its absence still leaves a mark.

Mostly centered around make-shift saunas the Russians built, but not always, and saunas couldn\u2019t explain what happened on the last night. There was still a kind of joy in the country then, like the release of a good stretch after a long journey. For years the Soviets had forbidden travel on the plateau, but the geographical society had eventually talked their way in and we joined them. We landed in Norilsk, gliding over nuclear silos and nickel mines and carrying a bag full of cash. With our money the Russians bought supplies and loaded them into an aging military helicopter\u2014wood stoves, axes, greasy canvas tents, oven mitts stuffed with nails. The dog we brought to frighten bears. It was hard going. What is the tundra but a cold swamp, vicious, beautiful, and grasping? On the last night the expedition leader finally unlocked his supply of vodka and soon all clothing vanished. Then, someone found the flare guns and started shooting up the sky like he was trying to knock out the northern lights, which waved and wailed above us in spirit silence. Was it joy, or madness? Too much time spent in empty country? Suddenly one of the tents burst into flames and the dog, the poor wretched dog, flew out of that collapsing pyre in a howling streak. Men cursed and fell and cried as they chased the flaming creature, their voices thick and slobbery, bodies pale as stars. Finally someone caught it and rubbed the fire from its fur. In the end the dog lived. Who knows how, but it did.\n\u2014\nWater. It runs through all of our work. In every story, every photo photograph, water is present\u2014or by its absence still leaves a mark. This series is an exploration of ideas and places that are connected by water, and the ways our lives, memories and work have been shaped by it. Join us @randyolson & @neilshea13 for the journey.\n\u2014\n#russia #siberia #norilsk #arctic #permafrost #taiga #tundra #vodka #lakes #explore #russiangeographicalsociety #watershedstories #adryseason @thephotosociety @natgeocreative",

Some have contacts with hospitals or casinos to bring plastic waste into the slums for processing. Others sort white bottles, or broken plastic buckets. Some groups have access to vehicles and can take the material to junk shops that store the waste in the same way a wheat farmer stores the grain, waiting for better pricing. And finally there are those with big trucks who take the plastic bales to ports or large local processing companies. Sometimes the plastic doesn\u2019t make it out of the slums. There are businesses that make finished plastic objects like flip flops from the plastic waste being sorted by the business next door. #PlanetorPlastic @thephotosociety @natgeocreative\n_________\nThese images are part of a multiyear effort at National Geographic to raise awareness about the global plastic waste crisis.

At one point, she only had 90 days of water left for 16 families (teachers are housed at school complex). The well got down to 15 feet of standing water. Lazbuddie as well as towns all the way north to South Dakota depend on the Ogallala aquifer. There are 88,000 wells around her in the TX panhandle and the area has the least water from the aquifer underneath, the least regulation, the least recharge and the highest density of wells.
