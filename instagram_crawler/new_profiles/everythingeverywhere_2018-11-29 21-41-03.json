This is the same number os Queen Elizabeth II. I suppose you are pretty well traveled when you are in a league with the Queen.\n\u2800\nSecond, this is the 200th territory on the Traveler\u2019s Century Club (TCC) which I have visited. The TCC list divides the world into 327 territories which includes places like Greenland, Puerto Rico, and other geographically and politically distinct places which are not necessarily countries. I visited my 100th TCC territory back in 2011, and my 150th in 2014.\n\u2800\nThird, there are four countries in the world which are made up entirely of coral atolls. With my visit to the Maldives, I have now visited all four. The other three are Kiribati, Tuvalu, and the Marshall Islands.\n\u2800\nFourth, this is my first trip anywhere in the Indian Ocean. I haven\u2019t visited any of the islands or territories in the ocean up until now. Other places like Mauritius and the Seychelles are also high on my list for future visits.\n\u2800\nFifth, this is the FIRST drone photo which I\u2019ve posted to Instagram! I\u2019ve been testing a Parrot Anafi and I am loving it so far. Hopefully, many more drone photos to follow. (I did a short flight in Sri Lanka, but literally 30 seconds after I launched it, it started to rain). Went out to an uninhabited island today and was able to go nuts doing drone stuff. It was great fun.\n\u2800\nTomorrow I start the very long process of going back home. I figure it will take me about 36 hours, and that includes 4 flights and 1 boat ride.\n\u2800\n#everythingeverywhere #maldives #cinnamonhotels #srilankanairlines #tbcasia #anafi #parrotanafi"

However, I\u2019m currently on a pre-conference tour in the Central Sri Lankan city of Kandy.\n\nAfter the conference I\u2019m taking a short trip to the Maldives because I haven\u2019t been there before either, and I figure I\u2019m so close I might as well visit.\n\nMake sure to check out my Instagram stories to get full coverage.\n\nThis photo was taken in the Knuckles Mountain Range, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\u2800\n#everythingeverywhere #unesco #worldheritage #worldheritagesites #srilanka #cinnamonhotels #srilankanairlines #tbcasia"

They share perfectly posed photos of themselves in designer clothes in exotic locations.\n\u2800\u2800\nUnfortunately, travel is usually never like that. Being tired and hungry after 2 days of sitting in airplanes and airports with body odor because you haven\u2019t been able to take a shower is more the norm. You deal with mostly with crappy airplane food and dirty airport toilets, not wistfully looking out into the distance as you hold a cup of coffee with both hands.\n\u2800\u2800\nThere is a grittiness to travel which is seldom shown on Instagram, and I suppose it is the part of travel which most people aren\u2019t interested in seeing. Nonetheless, that is what travel is.\n\u2800\u2800\nThere are very few images of myself which I put on my Instagram account because I am more interested in trying to get people interested in the places I visit, not trying to convince everyone I lead a glamorous life.\n\u2800\u2800\nThis photo was taken on a small sand bar in the Maldives. The @cinnamonhotels resort I stayed at took several of us out on a day trip to the sand bar. I wasn\u2019t sure of it at first, but it turned out to be a lot of fun. There were no people, so we could go nuts flying our drones. I took my Parrot Anafi up to 500 feet to get this view of the island we were on. You can see us as black dots in one of the corners.\n\u2800\n#everythingeverywhere #maldives #cinnamonhotels #tbcasia #anafi #parrotanafi"

With the Daylight Savings change, it is exactly a 12 hour change in time between Minnesota and the Maldives. I\u2019ve been sleeping and waking up at really odd hours and I haven\u2019t been able to adjust my internal clock yet.\n\u2800\nTo make matters worse, it is unseasonably cold here for early November. We\u2019ve already had several inches of snow and temperatures last night dipped down to 8F (-13.3C). We usually don\u2019t see those sort of temperatures until January or February.\n\u2800\nThankfully, I won\u2019t have to deal with the cold too much longer. I\u2019ll be off to Spain in about two weeks where things should be much warmer.\n\u2800\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time in Spain, but there is still a large part of the country I have yet to visit. I\u2019ve primarily spent time in Catalonia, especially in the region of Girona.\n\u2800\nOne of my favorite places in Catalonia is the Val de Nuria. It is a ski resort in the winter and a great place to hike in the summer. I took this photo on one of my previous trips there in 2011.\n\u2800 \u2800\n#everythingeverywhere #spain #visitspain #incostabrava #catalunyaexperience #inpyrenees #catalonia #catalunya #girona #mountains"
