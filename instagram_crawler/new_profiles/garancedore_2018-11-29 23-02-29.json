A full moon on the ocean - does it get any more sublime?\n.\nWhat a way to pause and be thankful for all the lessons I have learned this year and all the wonderful people that make my life.\n.\nSpecifically on this one, thank you Tom and Anthony @mistersperduti @partnersandspade - and thank you to all the people who sent me the best recommendations about the island as well as to @alohanif who a few years ago showed me the way to Hawaii\u2019s heart.\n.\nToday I am on my way to Chile, to the Atacama Desert for our retreat on self discovery with @atelierdore - there again we will be so close to the stars and the moon - but this time it will be supported by each other in communion. .\nI can\u2019t wait to share more with you."

Because \u00ab pretty \u00bb can become a prison.\n.\nA bright, colorful, smiling photo will almost always get more likes than a dark, imperfect, real photo. .\nFor any creator it is a curse. Imagine any artist creating with \u201clikes\u201d in mind? How many major works of art would have been turned into \u201cpretty\u201d instead of challenging, deep, thought-provoking?\n.\nHow many messages would have been transformed into just a punchline?\n.\nI have always been afraid of numbers. Statistics and numbers. Gah! They\u2019re the enemy of my creativity. They often kill it.\n.\nWhen \u201clikes\u201d appeared, I don\u2019t think anybody knew what tyranny they would become. Because we\u2019re all human. We\u2019re made of emotions. I don\u2019t know one person who can honestly say she doesn\u2019t get a boost the more likes she gets.\n.\nI wish Instagram would come up with a way to opt out of numbers. To have a version of it as an option that wouldn\u2019t show you the number of followers of one person, the numbers of likes and not count the number of comments.\n.\nYou would be able to chose what option you prefer. If you like counting your likes, go at it.\n.\nBut if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t like having numbers thrown at your face all day long, good or bad - you would just switch numbers off and Instagram could become what I see in it, a fascinating platform for self expression.\n.\nThis system would have traps too - but at least it would be a start?\n.\nI know Instagram implemented changes in terms of controlling the time we spend on it - but I honestly don\u2019t believe in this at all.\n.\nIt\u2019s, again, putting all the responsibility and guilt on the user, treating us as addicts... Which we probably are.\n.\nI believe in making people\u2019s emotional lives easier, not more complicated. I believe we can create tools that bring us more freedom. And I really believe it\u2019s time to take mental health seriously.\n.\nI would love to hear your thoughts on this!\n#gdmentalhealthjourney"

We were both wearing @vans once we figured that out that basically was it. We jumped on each other and started talking and laughing like we had known eachother forever.\n.\nShe also told me she was getting married a few days later, and showed me her dress, and I said be careful I might crash that wedding! To which she said : you should!!!\n.\nWe laughed about it and that was it.\n.\nThen a few days later I went to visit her in her amazing factory (yes she has a factory) with @em_note and we were still joking about the wedding when, just like that, she popped an invite and was like \u201cCome!!!\u201d\n.\nI looked at Emily and she said \u201cGO! You should go!\u201d\n.\nI knew @clarevivier was going to be at the wedding and I was about to go have coffee with her.\n.\nSo I told Ellen \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. I am seeing Clare right after this. I am gonna tell her about all this. She\u2019s a reasonable woman. She\u2019ll tell me you\u2019re crazy. If she doesn\u2019t, I promise I\u2019ll come.\u201d\n.\nThe second I talked to Clare she was like \u201cOh, come, you can stay with us!!!\u201d I didn\u2019t even know who \u201cus\u201d was, but I was like okay now. This is it I am going.\n.\nThis is the story of how I ended up in Mexico at the wedding of a new best friend I had just met two weeks ago, with one lady I thought was reasonable but is actually way more fun than me and another woman I didn\u2019t know but said \u201cYay I\u2019ll share my bed with a total stranger\u201d (Clare and Jen ended up sharing the bed and I spread myself leisurely on the other one) - and who I completely fell in love with, @jengotch .\n.\nAnd all that just says how special and crazy and fabulous @ellenmariebennett is and how happy I am for her and @caseycaplowe and all the fabulous people around them.\n.\nCheck out my stories highlights if you want to see more of that fabulous, fabulous weekend and how much I loved my sexy roommates. #ebxcc"

The first one was the intimate and heart warming one of one of my closest friend (or more like, sister), @em_note in Italy, and the second one was the giant and incredible feast of a very new and incredibly dear friend, @ellenmariebennett (more photos to come)\n.\nEach time I sneaked in a few moments before the ceremony to give a hug. And each time I was taken by the palpable and incredible emotion. And by the joy that I felt for the bride in that suspended moment in time.\n.\nPS : It\u2019s my speech I have in my hand. I took it really seriously and came with giant papers in hand. I was told there is nothing worse than reading from a phone. Very true - next time I\u2019ll take it to the next level and have actual cards. So chic.\n.\nPPS : Oh also, isn\u2019t that dress awesome!?? It\u2019s from @ladoublej and it felt soooo perfect for a Tuscan wedding...\n.\nPPPS : I can\u2019t vote in America because I am French, so please go vote for me. It is so so so important!!!"

Right now she\u2019s with her dog sitter and it\u2019s okay but I want to take her on more of my trips. She\u2019s totally cool on a plane, sleeps in her bag, doesn\u2019t make a noise and people don\u2019t even notice her.\n.\nDo you guys have any tips for traveling to different countries with a small dog?\n.\nPS - a lot of people who see her are surprised by how small she is, apparently she looks bigger in photos but she\u2019s just 21 pounds :).\n.\nPPS : this her rolled up in one of my fuzzy pillows. She loves to be super warm \ud83d\ude0c #muttsofinstagram"
