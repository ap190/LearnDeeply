Why do some THRIVE and others get stuck in FAILURE?\n-\nIn October I dug into this. Like REALLY DUG!\n-\nI decided to take the leap and find answers.\n-\nI went to the best of the best and asked them the hard questions and recorded along the way!\n-\nThe first 20 episodes are live on iTunes and stitcher.\n-\nSooooo-\nWhy this podcast? I mean there are so many podcast out there!\n-\nI\u2019m a podcast junkie for real but I found myself asking questions out loud when I would listen to others. I wanted to know more- sometimes things they were not asking.\n-\nI wanted to know the \u201cSTEPS\u201d on how some were able to create and achieve EVERYTHING from nothing while others get stuck!\n-\nI wanted to know WHAT sets a part those who achieve high success in LIFE : in fat loss, finances, relationships or health and those that don\u2019t. What makes those ACHIEVE greatness while others get stuck in failures?\n-\nSo I went on this mission. To learn from the BEST on how to level up.\n-\nI thought if I could bring those who have MASTERED this to more people, couldn\u2019t more master this?\n-\nAnd so the journey has begun and there is no stopping me now!\n-\nIf you haven\u2019t checked it out on iTunes yet I hope you will! I can\u2019t WAIT for you to meet the guest I have recorded and the new ones I have in store for you! As you get to know my guest you will hear a theme- I will always ask them:\n-\nWhen odds were stacked against us, how did you shift and create Everything from Nothing? How did they Level UP when they were not feeling it yet? Or when they had a big set back?\n-\nOn this podcast I talk to some of the most inspiring and courageous men and women on the planet, who at their worst, learned how to achieve success greater than they ever dreamed possible LEVELING UP- creating EVERYTHING from nothing.\n-\nAccess this in iTunes or by clicking the link in my bio!\n-\nMake sure to subscribe so you will always know when new episodes are up AND if you love them, please leave me a review so I know how I\u2019m doing and share with others so they can listen and learn too! \ud83e\udd17\n@leveling_up_podcast"

If I\u2019m in jeans or a cute outfits I for sure won\u2019t want to rally so I PUT THEM ON.\n\n2. I take it outside. Something about the fresh air, sunlight, views- changes my mood.\n\n3.i tell myself just 10 minutes.\nI commit to moving my body for ten minutes and promise myself I can absolutely quit when that ten minutes is over!\n-\nSpoiler alert- normally that ten minutes goes longer and ends up being a great workout!\n\nToodays more all with a @bosu_fitness #stability ball!"

Do you have one?\n-\nOne of the commonalities of all the amazing guest I\u2019ve featured on @leveling_up_podcast is their STRONG morning routine and habits.\n-\nSome of the commonalities they share: \ud83d\udc95No cell phones first thing in morning\n\ud83d\udc95The move their bodies (cardio/workout/stretch) early am\n\ud83d\udc95A practice of Gratitude and meditation\n\ud83d\udc95They ground themselves in their vision of the day before others needs/request start to trickle in.\n\ud83d\udc95They read or listen to an audio book or podcast first thing to fuel their mind - -\nWorking on consistency with my morning routine."

Start on your back with your legs straight out in front of you (or bent if that is too hard) and pull yourself up to the bar. Repeat these dips. There are no magic numbers, just do what is challenging for you! Even if that means working toward just 1! The idea here is to progress. Once you are able to do several of these easily in a row you are able to advance to the big bar.\n-\nStep 2: Hang on High Bar.\nThe first step here is to just hang. Once you are able to hang, you are going to slowly try to work your way up. This might look like one inch at a time. That is okay! Anything is progression. Repetition of this will eventually get you to where you are able to do a complete chin up.\n-\nStep 3: Assisted High Bar.\nIf you are struggling still, try using something to rest your feet on to help you work toward the up and over motion. But make sure you are using your arms to lift as much as possible, and not your legs.\n-\nStep 4: Repetition.\nOnce you are able to successfully do one chin up on the big bar, keep working at increasing your repetitions.\n-\nJust an example of one of the PROGRESSION exercises I teach in my STRONGER program on sale today (40% off!) coupon HERS40 www.nataliejillfitness.com/stronger/ or link in my bio"
