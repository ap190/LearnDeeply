A later discovery of the pyramid of Saqqara on his first trip to Egypt in 1958 strengthened this interest, and over the course of his career, he traveled extensively to Mexico, Guatemala, and Egypt to document these wonders. .\nFor more info, please visit magnumphotos.com/events.\n.\nPHOTO: Monument to the Unknown Soldier.

                        "comment": "\u201cWhen we said that in a family there was no bread it was not a metaphor\u201d - Ferdinando Scianna\n.\nGrowing up arround poverty in Sicily, Magnum photographer Ferdinando Scianna's childhood impacted his approach to his work documenting poverty in Naples in the mid-90s. The photographer's own experience informed his concern to protect the \u201cintegrity and dignity\u201d of his subjects, who, despite the precariousness of daily life, are shown in his portraits as composed, affectionate and house-proud.\n.\nIn a new interview, we speak to Scianna about the work, and how the issues highlighted persist in the region today.
