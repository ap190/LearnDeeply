It was love at first sight many years ago and every visit since just endears me more to this waterfront gem in British Columbia. That\u2019s why I was beyond excited to visit recently, during my favorite season to be in Canada - Autumn, during a hosted stay with @fairmonthotels. My trip to BC actually began with two nights down in Victoria at @fairmontempress where it was all about discovering their recent re-design, the phenomenal menus at @qattheempress et @teaattheempress and the impressive stories of one of Canada\u2019s most grand, historic hotels. Stay tuned for my photos from the Empress, @fairmontwaterfront, what I learned about the area\u2019s Indigenous culture which is tied into the culinary program of @arcdining - and more beautiful scenery from @hellobc! \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\udf41\ud83c\udf42 #FairmontMoments #ExploreBC"

When Veterans Day occurred it reminded me, with a smile, that this breakfast led to my having a wonderful conversation with an older gentleman who is a Veteran and who was staying at the hotel when I was. He thought my breakfast was far too healthy to be one that would also taste good. Suggesting I swap it out for pancakes like he had with a wink and a chuckle, he was quite amused when I told him that in fact it was really delicious and though healthy, very enjoyable for me to eat. The type of breakfast I actually look forward to and don\u2019t get to eat often enough in fact. However, wanting to fully support his pancake habit (for it soon became evident it is) I then preceded to tell him about my family history with pancakes. That they are something my mum has cooked for us for as long as I can remember. Given she makes pancakes better than anyone else, and that hers are Swedish Pancakes which I\u2019ve now come to prefer, with only real Vermont Maple Syrup, well...... when I travel, it\u2019s just not the same. No matter how good the pancakes are, they\u2019re never as good as my mother\u2019s. So instead I choose to enjoy those when I visit her, and explore other foods when I travel. We had a nice talk but eventually the gentleman went back to his paper and his pancakes and I devoured my delectable Avocado Toast, salad and fruit bowl at the table next to his in @qattheempress. Our connection might not have lasted for long but food brought us together for a moment and I find that food usually does bring people together in a way few other things do. After all, it\u2019s something we all need to survive and it\u2019s something we usually all have stories about that we can share.\n.\nMy goal with food now is to never miss those connections, those stories. To always be open to the ways a meal can open doors. And I\u2019m grateful for the moment this meal provided during my hosted stay at #FairmontEmpress where their kitchen garden ensured that much of this was as fresh as possible and locally-sourced. Another thing that always makes me happy where food is concerned. \u2764\ufe0f #FairmontMoments"

But a funny thing happened, I realized I don\u2019t miss living on the East Coast. When I landed at LAX, I weirdly started crying happy tears. I don\u2019t know if this will be my home forever or if it\u2019s just for another chapter. After all, I\u2019ve had a lot of homes in my life. But for this moment, at this time, I love Los Angeles and California in general. I love that it has the artsy, alternative vibes that I used to think New York had. It\u2019s got the freaks and the geeks and the creative people who make me feel lazy as a mere photographer \u2014 who\u2019ve renewed my desire to dream big. Not just to survive. It\u2019s got magic. And sometimes it\u2019s just a set. Sometimes it\u2019s oh-so-real. My point is it\u2019s my place. For now. And it feels good to like coming home again.\n.\nI took this photo at LACMA during one of my earliest trips to Los Angeles as a tourist, with the first version of the @moment lens on iPhone. And while I don\u2019t post as many mobile photos to my feed these days - I like returning to these moments once in a while so that things aren\u2019t always so completely perfect. A little distortion is good now and then here on Instagram where all too often things seem curated to the point of fakeness..."

Switching gears to a spot @dante.vincent and I discovered because of the @explorest app - that I paid to have access to when we moved here - we drove up into the hills instead. Once above the fog, we found the most stunning colors in the sky and eventually this vista above Malibu Canyon. A small pullout was already full of other photographers when we first parked and as the night wore on, people came and went but we stayed to try and get the Milky Way since it is so close to a new moon. The fog left, then it came back and eventually the sky clouded over so much that it was clear the Milky Way wasn\u2019t ever going to be fully visible. But it didn\u2019t matter in the end. The effect of being in that spot for as long as we were is that I was so profoundly grateful to be so close to home and yet feel so far away from a big city. Grateful and thankful.\n.\nEdited to add: Nothing is on fire here! And there\u2019s no destruction. What some have attributed to wildfire or lava when looking at this image is in fact the effect of the lights from cars captured at a 20 second exposure through the fog. Dant\u00e9 & I thought it looked more like Hawaii when we were standing here taking photos but it is in fact California."

To own privilege if we were born with it and not try to deny it or worry it will be taken away if we choose to lift up those born without it. To resist the wave of negativity and the lure of lies that prey on our self consciousness. To love more people of all shapes, sizes, colors, etc etc and discriminate less. To be less intent on our own superiority and more prone to just plain listening instead of talking. To find more ways to let courage rule our actions instead of letting fear hold us back. To always be willing to learn. To recognize that mankind\u2019s strength lies in embracing our differences and the reality that no man is an island, nor is any one country. And to own the actual fact that we must work together to survive, to ensure our planet does too.\n.\nor to paraphrase Lewis, \u201cWe can't go back and change the beginning, but we can start where we are and change the ending.\u201d"

It was a gift that was not lost on me as I walked through the event space and saw an industry that\u2019s still dominated by men - at least at the expo. There are so many amazing female photographers in this world, taking such incredible photographs, promoting ideas that will lead to a better world. I hope to return one day and see a more inclusive, even representation of all creatives at Photo Plus. Until that time, I\u2019m going to have a think on how I can help bring about that change for the better.\n.\nLet\u2019s start by filling the comments with recommendations of female photographers we know and love. For example, I\u2019m constantly blown away by the work of @annstreetstudio and I would have loved to see her on a stage at #photoplusexpo. I also love what @sarahsloboda has done for children\u2019s portrait photography. And @bontraveler & @rhitaylor consistently make me want to visit every single place they visit with their singular take on travel photography.\n.\nIf you don\u2019t yet know their work, check them out! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude18"

In fact, the Hindu Temple where he took this photo of me is very very close to the epicenter of the Woolsey Fire that has now caused Malibu to be evacuated. This naturally beautiful part of SoCal is often thought of only in the context of celebrities but many many hard-working, non-famous people live in this area and have now been forced to leave their homes and even in some cases already... lose their homes.\n.\nAs you see the news, or spread the news, have some compassion for these people and all the people affected by these fires; choose to do something for them, if you can, instead of just contributing to sensationalizing. I can\u2019t believe how many people I\u2019ve seen actually saying in response to news of the fires things to the effect of, \u201cCelebrities deserve it. Who cares!\u201d No one *deserves* this kind of loss. \ud83d\udc94"

My mother brought me home from the hospital in a burnt orange model and ever since then VW has been a part of my family\u2019s story off and on; a constant presence that always brings a smile to my face. What is it about the shape, the alter egos like Herbie and Superbug, the connections that can be made to our own histories and that of people we don\u2019t even know. Sure it might be just a car but it\u2019s also not ever going to be just a car. Not to me. It\u2019s one of the most enduring symbols of the age of mass transportation that I was born into and when it\u2019s gone - I am glad that it won\u2019t ever actually be gone, because so many vintage Beetles will still be out and about just like this one was on the streets of Los Angeles and in places all around the world... #VWLove"
