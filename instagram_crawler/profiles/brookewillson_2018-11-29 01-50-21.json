I was working all day snow plowing roads - 14 hour day... left my car in the parking lot as another worker picked me up, and it won\u2019t start\u2019 I reply \u2018100% of course I do! I\u2019ll help ya\u2019 ... He honestly thanked me 20x over saying he tried to flag down a number of vehicles and no ones stopped to help him. Blows my mind TBH, he said \u2018I feel I don\u2019t even look weird or unapproachable, why doesn\u2019t anyone wanna help a person out\u2019 especially in this cold. He insisted on taking my number to \u2018repay\u2019 me some how, all I said it please don\u2019t worry about it just return the favour tothe next person... I drove through the drive through, placed my order, I get to the window and the guys standing outside insisting on paying for me. What a guy. What a day. #payitforward Time for some Netflix and perhaps a glass of wine?

Also stoked cause I am heading to the mountains on Sunday for two days of adventure, stayin at a little cabin, having some down time, AND hitting the slopes Monday afternoon at @sunshinevillage \ud83c\udfbf .
