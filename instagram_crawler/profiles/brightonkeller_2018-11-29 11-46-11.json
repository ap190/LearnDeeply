But a few months ago I started making a list at the beginning of the month of friendships I wanted to cultivate. Even the simple act of writing their names down each month has helped me to be intentional about prioritizing time together. I also use that list as a prayer list to remember to be praying for them throughout the month. Personally, I keep it simple and try to limit to only 3 or 4 people so I don\u2019t overwhelm myself.\n.\nI\u2019m curious, do you have a list of things you do at the beginning of the month? If so, what\u2019s ONE THING you try and do each month??\n.\nPS:: Dallas friends, have you tried out the new @gatherkitchen location in Preston center?? \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc",

We were built for community and need each other! But it\u2019s so easy to get caught up in our routines, staying in, cancelling plans or watching Netflix and miss out on the joy and blessing of community and friendship. When I was in high school and college, community and friendships were pretty easy. Everyone was always around and we were together all the time. But gosh, post grad life is different. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it takes a lot more effort and intentionality. I want to encourage you this week to invest in your people!

I\u2019ve had my fair share of funks during the holidays, and I think it\u2019s one of the hardest times to go through one. It\u2019s like we\u2019re not supposed to feel anything but cheery and totally awesome from November-December.\n\nBut that\u2019s not realistic. People have funks all the time, no matter the month, and a lot of the time it\u2019s out of our control.

In scripture it says that where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom (2 Corinthians 2:17). We find freedom, life, and peace THROUGH the Holy Spirit.\n\nBut, what does that mean?\n\nThis verse helps me discern whether I am walking in the Spirit or in my flesh on a regular basis. When I am walking in condemnation or fear, I ask myself, \"Is there freedom or life in this?\" Nope. In that moment (which is often), I have to consciously pivot AWAY from me and TOWARDS Him. Some days I don't feel the freedom to love others around me well. I feel guarded or I compare. There is no life or peace there because I am loving them with my own strength. Some days I don\u2019t feel freedom to work (and serve) without expectation or need of affirmation. There is no life or peace there either because I am looking to work to satisfy in a way it never can.\n\nIn those moments, when I realize I\u2019m trying to do it all on my own, I find freedom in remembering this:: His Spirit can and will equip me. I don't have the power it takes to do it on my own and that\u2019s okay. The Spirit is our Helper. I can ask for help. And so can you \ud83d\udc95 That is SO freeing. And something I need to be reminded to step into every single day!\n\nI hope you found this to be encouraging! I love talking about my faith on stories, but I really struggle to put my experiences into words (and especially into a photo). I\u2019m pushing through that. I\u2019m trying. \ud83d\udc95 I hope you can find some freedom for yourself today I\u2019m asking the Spirit for help, in surrendering whatever it is your struggling with to Him.",

You might mess up and have to try again, but you can still keep moving - one foot in front of the other. Like I talked about in my stories yesterday, you have what you need to be faithful TODAY.\n\nIf you feel stuck or paralyzed by your to-do list (or messy house) this morning, keep reading.\n\nHOW to get UNSTUCK:: start ridiculously small. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with how difficult a task is, then break it down into stupid tiny pieces. It will be easier to take the next step. Do one little thing - the next step. this will build your confidence and get you some momentum. Then do the next.\n\nWhat\u2019s one thing you\u2019re going to do today?

Or where\u2019s somewhere you went recently??\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nI just got back to Dallas from a fun little weekend in Austin. And even though it was a short (and fun!) trip, something about traveling (no matter how far or long) always calls for a little post-travel recovery/maintenance before jumping right back into the normal routines of life!\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nI wanted to share 3 self-care tips for getting back into the swing of things after traveling (or in general)::\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n1. Drink a lot of water : \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m so bad at it y\u2019all. BUT it\u2019s so important - especially post-travel. It helps flush out your body and rehydrate you from a day of travel.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n2. Write it all down : AKA do a BRAIN DUMP! I love to pull up a seat in front of my fireplace or the couch, put on some chill music, and journal so I can remember my travel experiences while they are fresh on my mind - things I thought about, realized, etc. This also helps me get everything out of my head so I can clear out my head and my heart for the week ahead!\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n3. Take a hot bath : my favorite part of Sunday nights \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc baths help my crazy mind SLOW down! \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nHow do you wind down after a weekend?",

But shifting my perspective from \u201cI have to do it all myself and do it well\u201d to \u201clet me just serve someone today to the best of my ability\u201d has given me such relief and is slowly taking the self-inflicted weight off my shoulders.\n\nIn today's technological culture, everything is connected. We can share ideas and connect with people from all over the world - at any given moment. It's an exciting time really. But within reason - in moderation, with boundaries. This is key.\n\nI've been feeling a little **too** \u201cone with the technology\u201d \ud83d\ude06 \u2026if you know what I mean? And that\u2019s EVEN WITH taking breaks and posting less. I think maybe the breaks haven\u2019t been **as** renewing as I\u2019d hoped bc it was more like pressing PAUSE when what I really need is a REFRESH.\n\nDoes that make sense? Like, yeah, it was nice to step away for a minute. But I came back with the same worries, anxieties, and affirmation-seeking spirit. Maybe I could fight it for a few days, but not for long.\n\nYesterday morning, after meeting with a friend and sharing #allmyFEELS, she told me she was going to pray that I find freedom in my work. I was like, OMG YES. THAT\u2019S WHAT I NEED. Thanks for putting everything into A WORD. That really resonated with me - FREEDOM.\n\nWe find freedom when we surrender - when we shift the focus from ourselves to others. When we quit trying to grasp and control and cling so tightly. When we embrace collaboration over competition.\n\nThink about an area of your life where you feel STUCK. Or enslaved. Or just A LOT of pressure? Is it possibly because you\u2019re focusing too much on the outcome? Or trying to do everything yourself? Trying to control every little detail?\n\nWhat\u2019s one area of your life where you would love to find more freedom?\n\nhttp://liketk.it/2y8aN\n\nPS:: I promise not every caption will be this long!!! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude06",

Last night, we went and saw Instant Family and Y\u2019ALL, it was ADORABLE! Sweet moments, funny moments, all the the good feels! I HIGHLY recommend it if you\u2019re wanting to go see a FEEL GOOD movie this weekend! I also saw CREED II earlier this week and enjoyed it as well! Oh, and we watched the Proposal on Thursday and GOSH, that\u2019s such a good movie. Sandra Bullock is my favorite!\n.\nHave you seen any movies lately?!
