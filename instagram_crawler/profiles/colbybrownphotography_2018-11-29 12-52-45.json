If you time your trip during the right times of the day, the light reflecting into the canyon can be magical! However you not only have to deal with crowds, but also a whole lot of dust and sand.\n\nThis brings me to today's topic, keeping your gear clean and working in challenging environments. What questions do you have about protecting your own gear? What advice do you have to share with our community for the environments you personally find yourself working in?\n\nAlso, I have some news about my current community giveaway that I will share via my IG stories later tonight! Untill then, let's start the conversation! :)"

Often times it is when you least expect it that things and up working out in your favor.\n\nThis brings me to today's topic for our growing community, Resilience.

My first has been delayed, putting my connection in jeopardy...which brings me to today's community topic of conversation, TRAVEL HACKS. What ways have you learned to make traveling easier or less expensive. What is my favorite travel hack...download the Mobile Passport app if you are a US Resident. The lines for using it when re-entering the country are but a small fraction of even Global Entry. It is truly the travel industries best kept secret!\n\nOn a side note, it is time to select another random winner for my giveaway to win something awesome. One person will be picked at random from those engaging on this post. Ask a question, engage with others...help out your fellow travelers! Good luck!"

This lake is Laguna Colorada, which turns red because of the minerals found in the water. Visit at the right time of year and this lake is full of tens of thousands of Andean Flamingos.\n\nToday's topic of discussion, best times of day to shoot and why. Do you find yourself photography during the middle of the day or do you spend more time at the end of the day instead. Why? How would you convince someone to try your favorite part of the day?\n\nSoon I will have more news about my Giveaway as I this have three big prizes to giveaway. The Challenge is that I am in a very remote part of Canada right now photographing Polar Bears, so I might have to push back announcing those winner until I return on the 28th. More info coming soon!"

We had hiked up to the base of My Fit Roy and camped out for a few days before all of the wind died down. For one night, things were perfectly still and perfectly clear, which worked out great when I found some small ponds for reflections.\n\nThings brings me to today's topic, night photography. What questions do you have? What gear do you use? What is one piece of advice you have for something just looking to try it out? Share your thoughts below!"

In order to take this shot, I used a @formatthitech Circular Polarizer that allowed my camera to see through the water to the rocks just below.\n\nThis brings me to today's community topic and my next giveaway.
