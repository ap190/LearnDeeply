Half the time you see my power posts: blazer, bold brow, computer in one hand and inserted powerful feminist quote surrounding all sorts of yes we cans. (Don\u2019t get me wrong, yes we sure can!) but what you don\u2019t see is, behind those photos, is a girl just like you. \u2022\n\nI never have it \u201con\u201d 23/7. I have vegetative days where I look for my phone, forgetting I\u2019m holding it. Or get super anxious when I\u2019m juggling a thousand things all with the same deadlines. Never wanna get out of bed, stay in sweats, repeat the same outfit to meetings with zero shame. Compare my work with others and become my biggest critic ~ ever. I am that person. \u2022\n\nA reminder that no human is on all the time. Hence why we are called humans. We can only give it our best and then balance it with a nice few hours away from our work, a few hours being kinder to yourself and dive into a pedicure or something like that. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70 #bloggerstyle #greylayers #hustle #lightroompresets",
