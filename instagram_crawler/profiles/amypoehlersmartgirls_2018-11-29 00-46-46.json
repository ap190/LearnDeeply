In 2017, eight kids raised over $9,000 in the inaugural Kids4Cause event. On October 13 of this year, six kids rode the Wheels For Meals race with two more helping to raise over $4300 for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (so far).\n.\nThe new crop of riders was excited to join the team this season. The youngest rider was six years old and the others were all from Riya\u2019s 5th grade class at Clarendon Elementary, a San Francisco public school. The highest fundraiser of the group, Samson, donated his birthday to the cause asking for donations instead of gifts. And within their community, the group had coaching help from a local high schooler, in addition to the parents of the children involved. A true group effort!\n.\nLink in bio to learn more \ud83d\udc46"

We redefined the politics of possible in the Deep South \u2013 but our fight is far from over.\n\u2022\nWhen we kicked off our campaign in Albany almost a year and a half ago, we were told we\u2019d never win the Democratic primary. That a candidate like me in a state like Georgia would not stand a chance. \u2022\n\nBut we believe in Georgia. We believed in a new kind of campaign that respects every person and fights to earn, keep, and count every vote. And at every step of this journey, instead of falling prey to fear, instead of being blown off course by the winds of doubt, we forged on .\n\u2022\nWe reached out to communities across this state that very rarely see a candidate for governor. We activated and energized voters at a scale never before seen in Georgia Democratic politics. We won state House races, Senate races and a new seat in Congress. And we put America on notice that change is not coming \u2013 it has arrived. And you made it so .\n\u2022\nThis is only the beginning. We must keep fighting for the people who have always felt left behind, for the communities whose security and status are now in question. We must continue to stand united, to use the networks we\u2019ve built and with the Georgians we\u2019ve energized, to continue the fight for progress, for free and fair elections, and for equality.\n\u2022\nToday, I announce the launch of Fair Fight Georgia, an operation that will pursue accountability in Georgia\u2019s elections and integrity in the process of maintaining our voting rolls. We will channel the work of the past several weeks into a strong legal demand for reform of our election system in Georgia. And I will not waver in my commitment to work across party lines and across divisions to find a common purpose in protecting our democracy.\n\u2022\nOur state has been at the forefront of speaking truth to whatever power may lay claim to leadership \u2013 if only for the moment. We will win because we are Georgia. And we WILL get it done.\n\nStacey Abrams"
