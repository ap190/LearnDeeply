And one of my favorite uses is repurposing old scrap \"firewood\" like this walnut offcut. The JET's massive resaw ate this thing up quick and easy and I got some nice little boards, a few cool knotty panels and some turning blanks. Head over to the video (link in bio \ud83d\udc49 @fixthisbuildthat) to see all the other ways I use a bandsaw \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n#sponsored #jetwoodworking #builtwithJET #fixthisbuildthat",

This was 2 years ago when I built an outdoor coffee table, but what you don't see is just out of frame and behind the camera is my entire family (wife, kids, parents, plus an aunt and uncle) watching me put the concrete in the form. It was my first time working with concrete and it wasn't exactly what I'd call smooth going \ud83d\ude00. They were so worried for me and trying to give advice and of course I'm just trying to get the good shots for the video while I had no idea what I was doing. It was stressful, but fun to have them all in the shop watching and \"helping\". And every time I watch this vid I think of the people you can't see on the screen, my family. The people most important to me and the people who supported me to do what I love and take a plunge to leave my good paying job for a dream. Today I'm thankful for all the struggles, opportunities, and love that have shaped our lives and that I get to spend about 20 more hours a week with my kids than I did 2 years ago.

So we settled on 12 pairs, one for each month (not that most people should need to replace them that frequently). So it's a great opportunity to stock up on a bunch of different kinds of gloves like the 6 types I've got here in the shop.\n\nHere's what to do:\n- Go checkout @firm_grip_gloves if you aren't already\n- Tag a few friends who need some gloves\n- Head to fixthisbuildthat.com (link in bio \u261d\ufe0f) to enter the giveaway and get bonus entries\n\nEnds Thursday 11/29 at 8:00pm CST.

The way I use gloves the most in the shop is for rough material breakdown. Call me a wimp, but if I can avoid getting splinters from rough lumber and taking the time to pull them out then I'm happy \ud83d\ude00. And after the lumber is smooth I go sans gloves for the safety around fast spinning blades. Head to the giveaway page to see my favorites gloves (including these Veil ones I'm wearing here) and get entered \ud83d\udc4d.\n#ad #firmgripgloves #fixthisbuildthat",

In about 10 minutes I threw together this super basic version that would be good for circles up to about 8 inches for my bandsaw video (link in bio \ud83d\udc49 @fixthisbuildthat). All I used was a scrap of 3/4\" ply, a pine runner, and a small nail. You don't always have to get all fancy to make jigs. Sometimes a down and dirty version gets it done. What's your go to circle cutting method?\n#jigs #bandsaw",
