This part of Islay is magnetic to rogues, it would seem. To wit, right here in 1813 an American privateer, The True Blooded Yankee, built by Rhode Island men in France (clever way for the fledgeling United States of America to run a navy), captured six ships and set three afire. The town you see was built to house distillery workers. Across the road is the rogue distillery, Bruichladdich, constant confounder of the staid order of whisky in Scotland, where they distill a stiffly peated Port Charlotte whisky, some with Islay barley grown nearby. (Everyplace on Islay is nearby, the island is only 25 miles long, but that\u2019s plenty for eight distilleries. Islay is a whole whisky region unto itself.) A night like this it would be good to go into the pub in the Port Charlotte hotel and ask for an Octomore (with a whopping 80ppm of peat) from Bruichladdich. Sort of a high octane whisky.

(Not a bad side benefit.) The other benefit is the collective energy of the student photographers and the collective wisdom of the assembled faculty, which includes such luminaries as William Albert Allard, Jodi Cobb, Dave Black, Mike Forsberg, Mary Anne Golon, Kim Hubbard, Allen Murabayashi, Dave Showalter, Deanne Fitzmaurice, Melissa Groo, Stan Honda, Morgan Heim, Ron Taniwaki, and Wes Pitts. (Not a bad lineup.) It\u2019s an amazing learning experience, founded by the legendary Rich Clarkson and carried on today by Chris Steppig and his crew.\nEvenings bring the added bonus of presentations by the faculty. I\u2019m going to talk about my work in food and agriculture over the last 20 years for National Geographic and my ongoing efforts to connect agriculture with the fate of nature conservation. And somewhere along the line I\u2019ll talk about how I leveraged my twenty five years of photography in Scotland into a major focus of my professional life.

This far north on Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland the dusk just slides from the west around north and then into a long dawning in the northeast. To be alone with the stones that night was, well, magical \u2014 like all ancient religions are somehow magical. My photographer self had plenty of time to play with flashes (and flashlights) seeking images to match the experience. But I also had moments of sitting and wondering. Surely someone 5,000 years ago had sat and wondered in this exact same place.

I praised his dog and in those few minutes he recalled the dogs grandfather, who had been a genius, a true artist who contrived novel sheep herding maneuvers for the sheer thrill of invention. Allan could see, sometimes, remnants of that brilliance in the grandson, but he knew such gifts of talent are rare and did not expect to see another such legend again in his lifetime. #Scotland #castle @natgeo @natgeotravel @natgeocreative",

And with the sea encroaching from the nearby shore the story isn\u2019t over yet. The central tower (broch) was some 30 feet high when built, probably around 200 BC, by an itinerant band of broch-builders plying their business up and down Eynhallow Sound. Soon enough this local \u201cbig man\u201d was attracting followers eager to favor his protection by building their houses in the shadow of his. Hardly isolated (Roman amphora were found here) this might have been home to the Orkney King who submitted to Emperor Claudius in 43 AD. Looking down it was also easy for me to see that the North Sea eats at islands relentlessly and that the Broch sorely needs the protection of its sea wall, a modern addition. I love the way Orkney tells its story so freely. @natgeotravel @natgeo @natgeoexpeditions #orkney #scotland @visitorkney @orkneyjar_sigurd #ruins #history",

(If you liked liked my previous picture of Assynt you\u2019ll love the cover. Not my picture, BTW.) Besides being beautiful it details their conservation efforts for a wild Scotland. Here\u2019s what James Shooter wrote me about the book. \u2018SCOTLAND: A Rewilding Journey\u2019 is a new book by @scotlandbigpicture, a non-profit organisation set up by professional photographers and filmmakers who are all motivated by the need to rebuild healthy ecosystems across Scotland. This is a rallying call for a wilder Scotland, where forests abundant with life are regenerating, where rivers lined with alder and willow run freely, where damaged peatlands are revitalised and where oceans support the great whales. It portrays a vision for a wilder Scotland \u2013 a place where nature works, where wildlife flourishes and crucially, where people prosper.\u201d\nIllustrated by some of the Scotland\u2019s best (and most generous, I can tell you) nature photographers, (follow them all), including @peter_cairns_photography, @markhamblin.naturephotos, @jamesshooterphoto and @richardshucksmith.\nYou can order the book here: https://www.scotlandbigpicture.com/Store/books/scotland-a-rewilding-journey",
