One of my favorite parts about my job is the long term collaborations that result as a part of it. It\u2019s been fun to work with these guys trying to educate the public about what they do and the species in general and see cool things like this as well as be on the cutting edge of how science is using tools like social media to further their endeavors. Can\u2019t wait to get out in the field with them again soon. If you want to learn more about Lynx make sure to check them out.

On any given day my biggest threat is maybe having a bear charge me or say getting injured in the backcountry somehow. What you see here as a result is my version of that beauty, that truth.\nI can\u2019t fathom having to be scared for my life, or face the risk of assassination for bringing that truth forward while exercising my First Amendment rights. I am at a total loss thinking about Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist assassinated recently by Saudi Arabia in an operation that has essentially been condoned by the White House. I can\u2019t stand by and watch this get swept under the rug because of falling oil prices, arms or nuclear deals. If we as a society championing freedom and democracy for all are willing to accept the assassination of journalists working for a free press, I am afraid to find out where we go from here. Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press, are in the first amendment because they are the foundations of a free and open society. Democracy.\n\nI saw a post the other day with a journalist bagging on the \u201ccliched\u201d statement that \u201cjournalism gives voice to the voiceless\u201d\u2026.In this particular case, it seems clear to me that is exactly what we as a community of journalists should be doing. I refuse to stand by and watch this all go away without trying to use this feed for the common good. @whitehouse your actions regarding the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi are unacceptable and shameful. You\u2019re not destroying our country, you\u2019re destroying Democracy.\nWherever you\u2019re reading this, if you believe in Democracy I urge you to click on the link in my bio to find a list of your congressmen and women (or pick one, you can even find your congressional leaders on social media). Write to them today to let them know what you think. @senatorenzi @liz.cheney @senjohnbarrasso",

All the pieces are there, and largely functioning together as they have for millennia. There are a few chinks--declining king salmon populations come to mind--but this is really intact system and something not to be taken for granted.\u201d \ud83d\udc3a #commonground #publiclands #alaska #wild #wolves #puppies @nationalparkservice",
