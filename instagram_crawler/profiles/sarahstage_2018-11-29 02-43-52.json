My answer is you make time!\nBeing disciplined is one of the hardest things to do, i struggle with balancing my time with momlife , work life, and being a wife, daughter etc.\nWhat\u2019s helped me is choosing the same time every day for myself (even its 30 min)\nDoing that, gets you in a routine and helps you reach your goals faster while keeping a balance in your life.\nLet\u2019s be honest, we can think of a million reasons as to why we don\u2019t want to workout, we just need ONE reason to actually make it happen. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc For me that one reason is my family. I want to be strong and healthy for them too!\nWhat motivates you?\nFind that reason and think about it next time you are debating about working out \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc"
