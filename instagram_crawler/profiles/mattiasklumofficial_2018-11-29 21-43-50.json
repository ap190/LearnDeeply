This happens to be one of my favourite oak trees photographed close to our home near Lake M\u00e4laren, Sweden. Oak trees are just magnificent and provide a habitat super rich in biodiversity.\nOaks can host hundreds of species of insect, supplying many birds with an important food source. This time of year, mammals such as squirrels, badgers and deer take advantage of the falling acorns. #oak #pictureoftheday #protectbiodiversity #m\u00e4laren #uppsala #sweden #ekoln #nature #swedish #biodiversity #science @natgeo @thephotosociety @irisalexandrov @alexandrovklumofficial"

According to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International, the mountain gorilla population living in the Virunga mountains has grown\u2014 from 480 in 2010 to 604 as of June 2016! Combined with a separate mountain gorilla population living in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda, this brings the number of mountain gorillas to more than 1,000 individuals.\nThis reconfirms the mountain gorilla\u2019s status as the only wild ape population whose numbers are known to be increasing! Obviously by protecting mountain gorillas we ensure beautiful and resilient forests and not least livelihoods for local people too. #protectbiodiversity #nikonambassadors #mountaingorilla #virunga #mattiasklum @natgeotravel @irisalexandrov @thephotosociety @natgeo @alexandrovklumofficial"

Without lions to control them, these species can out-compete other animals, causing their extinction and reducing biodiversity.\nBy protecting a lion\u2019s landscape, we\u2019re helping the whole area to thrive, which doesn\u2019t just benefit wildlife but the people who rely on local natural resources too.\nLion population in Africa has declined by 43% in the past 20 years; unprecedented decline that scientists warn is unsustainable.\n#lions #africa #mombo #beauty #botswana #mattiasklum #gorgeous #savethebigcats #conservation #moremi #science @natgeo @natgeotravel @wwfsverige @alexandrovklumofficial @thephotosociety @irisalexandrov"

Because of this distinctive character it is called Barasingha, meaning \"twelve-tined.\"\nMature stags have 10 to 14 tines, and some have been known to have up to 20.\nThis animal is adapted to hard ground unlike swamp deer of Northern India which live in marshy swamps.

The great argus is native to the rainforests of Borneo, Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula in southeast Asia. This spectacular pheasant is undoubtedly suffering from the twin threats of habitat loss and hunting throughout its extensive range. It is probably undergoing rapid population reduction and is consequently classified as Near Threatened by IUCN.\nPhotographed in Danum Valley, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo for @natgeo #mattiasklum #protectbiodiversity #borneo #arguspheasant #worldanimalday #danumvalley #nikonambassador @natgeotravel @natgeo @thephotosociety @alexandrovklumofficial"

Every day is a good day to celebrate the importance and beauty of our marine worlds! Oceans cover roughly 71 percent of the globe, and they are as important to us as they are vast. Our oceans are home to most of the life on our planet and play a central role in the world's natural systems, like regulating our climate and absorbing carbon dioxide. Their wealth is truly beyond comprehension and there is still so much to learn.

The splash and spray each other with water and mud. They often \"trunk wrestle\" and practice fighting in pushing and pulling competitions.\nThey can usually stand and walk within an hour of birth and if a elephant calf loses its mother the other females in the group will take care of it. The bond between a baby elephant and its mother is frequently described as the closest of any animal on earth. This is not just another cute animal picture but in my opinion yet another reminder that it's not just humans that can show compassion, empathy and caring. Perhaps it\u00b4s finally time for us humans to realize that other species are much more advanced than what we used to know aknowledge and believe.

Group 4 was the very first group of gorillas to be studied by Dr. Fossey after she established the Karisoke Research Center and included individuals like Uncle Bert, who she named after her own uncle, and Digit, the first gorilla to accept her presence.\u201d Over the course of 1978, four gorillas in Group 4 were killed by poachers and another three died as a result of the group\u2019s disruption. By December of that year, only three of the original 11 group members remained together.\nWith her beloved Group 4 destroyed, and the mountain gorilla population headed toward a low point of only about 240 individuals, Fossey feared the species would go extinct before the year 2000.\nInstead, today, due to the intensive protection efforts Fossey initiated, mountain gorillas have reached a new historic milestone: their numbers have gradually increased over the past 30 years, and are up from 240 to 604, based on the latest census. (Another separate population of 400 individuals bring the total number of mountain gorillas to just over 1,000). I photographed this magnificent mountain gorilla in the Volcanos National Park, Rwanda.\nQuotes from @savinggorillas #dianfosseygorillafundinternational #protectbiodiversity #mountaingorilla #mattiasklum #nikonambassador @irisalexandrov @natgeotravel @natgeo @alexandrovklumofficial"

The fruits, seeds and pads form a major part of the diet of giant tortoises, land iguanas, finches and mockingbirds. It has been found that in arid areas, where the cactuses are usually the only available food source and grow very tall and tree-like, tortoises have evolved to have a different shape of the shell to be able to stretch up to reach the higher cactus pads.

When you manage to read nature around you your chances of seing things or even getting a photograph increases. This Bengal tiger in Kanha, India silently came out of the thickets only reveiled by some irritated langurs. After a century of decline, tiger numbers might finally be on the rise. At least 3,890 tigers remain in the wild and tigers may be one of the most revered animals, but much more work is needed to protect this species that\u2019s still vulnerable to extinction. Today is actually #worldtigerday !

I sometimes find this beautiful and pretty common snake by the water searching for prey, using sight and sense of smell. In the mythology of the Baltic people, the grass snake is a revered and sacred animal. It was frequently kept as a pet, living under a married couple's bed or in a special place near the hearth. Supposedly, snakes ate food given to them by hand.\nIn England, grass snakes are protected and cannot be harmed or traded without a licence. In Denmark, it is also protected as all species of reptiles were protected in 1981 and in my native Sweden since 2000. #lovesnakes #ecosystemservices #protectbiodiversity #sweden #natrixnatrix #mattiasalexandrovklum #grasssnake #nikonambassador @irisalexandrov @alexandrovklumofficial @natgeo @thephotosociety @natgeotravel"

This Sea-and-land-going snake, need air to breathe, and will coil up on rocks, under shells and foliage to digest its food and, every few months, shed skin.\nThese snakes feed almost exclusively on eels, and their neurotoxic venom has evolved accordingly. The eels are strong and have sharp teeth so a over dimensioned neurotoxin does it. The snake\u2019s toxic bite causes paralysis, which keeps its strong and speedy prey from escaping. Scientists study the genetic and molecular set-up by collecting venom and DNA samples from these snakes, their prey and predators and are hopeful that this sea krait may soon combat diseases and this will not affect the snakes in the wild at all.

This Nile crocodile that I photographed in Selous, Tanzania (In this photograph just about to swallow some well seasoned flesh from the dead hippo in the hackground) can eventually measure more than 18 feet long and weigh more than a ton. Relative to their enormous size, it's no wonder their large and powerful jaw muscles make crocodiles' snouts among the world's deadliest traps.

Among the best hunters in Africa, wild dogs (or painted dogs) have a higher kill rate than lions and can take down antelope that weigh as much as 225 kilos (500 pounds). They are notorious for a grisly efficiency that has made some people fear and hate them, if not shoot them on sight. This beautiful apex predator is important in its ecosystem and needs to be respected and protected! African wild dogs hunt in successful cooperative packs of 6 to 24 animals. Larger packs were more common before the dogs became endangered. #wilddog #doglovers #mattiasklum #tanzania #predator #africa #painteddog #protectbiodiversity #conservation #wwf #iucn @natgeo @thephotosociety @alexandrovklumofficial @irisalexandrov"

Lying in our bedroom early morning, windows open, listening to nightingales, common snipes and the deep, sighing fog-horn call of a bittern.\nAn amazing time of year! This Wood cranesbill,\nGeranium sylvaticum (Midsommarblomster in Swedish) grow everywhere outside our house. In Latin sylvaticum means \"of woodland\", referring to the plant's native habitat.\nThe flower colour ranges from mauve to irresistible sky blue, depending on soil conditions. This flower yields a blue-gray dye that was used in ancient Europe to dye war cloaks, believing it would protect them in battle. For this reason it was called Odin's Grace. #midsommarblomster #mattiasklum #woodcranesbill #irresistible #summersdream #liveyourdreams #love #nikonambassador #protectbiodiversity #protectbiodiversity @mattiasklumcollection @thephotosociety @natgeotravel @natgeo @irisalexandrov @alexandrovklumofficial"

Most people might think of lions as strictly African cats, but ten thousand years ago lions spanned vast sections of the globe, and so did obviously people, who\u2014as we multiplied and got increasingly organized\u2014put immense pressure on competitors at the top of the food chain. Now lions hold only a small fraction of their former habitat, and Asiatic lions, a genetically separate subspecies that split from African lions perhaps 100,000 years ago, hang on to an almost impossibly small slice of their former domain. India is the proud steward of these 400 or so lions, which live primarily in this 560-square-mile (1,450-square-kilometer) sanctuary in Gujarat. We must not forget to protect Asia's Last Lions and big cats everywhere! Please support @wwf and @wwfsverige .

A scissortail fusilier looks a bit stressed between the approaching shark and my lens. No wonder!\nThere are still about 500 species of shark in the world's oceans but at least 200 000 sharks are killed every day for the finning- and shark liver oil industry. Many species are now on the brink and by ridding the oceans of the sharks we destabilize resilient and strong ecosystems that truly support life as we know it! #sharks #protect #support #biodiversity #protectbiodiversity #ecosystem #ocean #conservation #nikonambassadors @alexandrovklumofficial @natgeo @thephotosociety"
