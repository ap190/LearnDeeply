Learn new languages.\n-\nBut what I do everyday is run @modernmacrame with a small team of amazing women.\n-\nIt\u2019s been over 6 years since I learned macram\u00e9 from my mom, and 3 years since I quit my day job and made this company my full time work(plus all the other things I do). This year I wrote a book that\u2019s in its 3rd printing!\n-\nSometimes the business flows, the ideas come in floods. And sometimes we feel stuck in a pinch point (how are we going to pay for all this inventory?! Make these new videos!? Get all my ideas off the ground?!)\n-\n80% of Modern Macram\u00e9 is providing rope, cord, special beads and other notions for all your crafting needs. The rest is teaching and designing custom work.\n-\nI\u2019m sharing all this here, because many people who know me, don\u2019t realize that ROPE is our main product. We imported 40 tons of it last year, and this year we are growing. Which is super cool! And it makes me laugh when I think about it.\nBesides rope, COMMUNITY and inspiration are my business, and the thing that gets me up every morning.\n-\nThis weekend, (and as much as possible) SHOP SMALL.\nEvery dollar you spend when you shop small has a direct impact on the small business owners you support. I tagged my outfit, everything I\u2019m wearing came from a small women owned business. Who are the businesses in your community you are excited to support?\n-\nThank you for reading and for your support!\n-\nAnd use code DREAMWEAVER to take 25% off everything on the modernmacrame.com (rope, pillows, art, plant hangers, macram\u00e9 kits, my book! etc)\nGet your mom or sister or girlfriend one of my books and some rope. She will thank you.\n#craftingcommunity -photo by @threadcaravan after our workshop in Asheville this summer at fav @eastforkpottery",
