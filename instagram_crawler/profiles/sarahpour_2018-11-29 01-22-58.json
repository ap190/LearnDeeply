You might have already seen it in my story - the last two days been a nightmare. After coming back from food shopping we saw that our car door was broken and almost all our gear stolen. But worst: We putted so much work, time and effort in taking all our photos, which I mostly not even have seen yet - thought \u201chey, enjoy this time. Edit a photo every now and then to post something. But leave the real editing fun for when your home.\u201d and someone who has not a single use for them steals your hard disks. Gosh, I still don\u2019t know how to feel. One moment I start laughing because dang, what actually did happen? The next moment I start crying because dang, I can\u2019t even remember all the places I\u2019ve been without my photos. .\nI\u2019m mostly not really \u201cpersonal\u201d on here. And because of that I\u2019m even more thankful and really, really surprised about how many of you are trying to help us. It might be useless and don\u2019t bring us our hard drives with all our photos back, but at least I know I tried what I can and know a lot of people helped with anything they could. As they say \u201cit\u2019s all about the community on here\u201d. I cannot thank you guys enough, but trust me, every message I got where someone offering help, made me smile and realise it\u2019s probably the best to do it the way we are doing. And who knows, maybe this crazy nightmare turns into a Disney story or something and we will be super duper lucky and get our photos somehow back. .\nTHANK YOU!!!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\u2665\ufe0f",

We went all those damn stairs up (1300ish stairs!!), walked more and more and decided to take a little path I have found leading away from the stairs. Found a little \u201cspot\u201d where I was super enthusiastic about, made @saatmann and Loki climb with me down, none of us could stand even a little bit as we slipped more than anything - until, and now I\u2019m happy he did, Christian said it\u2019s enough and we need to go back, it\u2019s too dangerous, that it\u2019s not worth for a photo. Climbed up, me of course super pissed and just a few steps down we found this old wall.
