It\u2019s a big theme in my life & practice & @stralayoga When you ask anyone if they want to do yoga, if they aren\u2019t already on the bandwagon you might be met with, \u201cnah I\u2019m not flexible, I can\u2019t quiet my mind, or I\u2019m just not interested in the dogma stuff.\u201d If you ask, do you want less stress and to create space in your life for yourself then you\u2019ll probably be met with welcome relief.\n.\nBut the practice needs to meet the promise. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc\n.\nHere is the thing guys. When you do things like walk into a little box to the top of your mat, clench your face to squeeze your thighs, or push your body in attempt to gain flexibility you are practicing creating less space, shrinking your capabilities and gaining more tension. Man, is your yoga stressing you out or burning you out? If so lets fix it!\n.\nStart with one simple mind set shift at a time. Move into a bigger space with each breath. Literally, from down dog, soften your self, shift your hips from side to side and let your feet and hands crawl on up. Shift your hips side to side to slide your hands on back.\n.\nGive it a try. Simple. But big shifts can make you fall in love with the power you have inside. That\u2019s where the \u201cyoga\u201d really is. When your practice feels like you, you are into something great. (New practice coming to you in this week\u2019s newsletter)\n.\n.\n#stralayoga"

Used to knit as many as possible on flights & give them all away. Was such a fun phase. Feels so great to give something useful, beautiful and unexpected. A few flight attendants who liked my projects ended up with hats and a lot of strangers and friends. I have a few flights coming up so thinking to hop back on. How can we do this best? I\u2019ll dream on it and get back to you soon. Now for some meditation and family day."

Whether meditation, yoga, tai chi, shiatsu, connecting with Daisy, or in a meeting, the same rules apply. I am only able to share what I embody. There is no faking it. Improving not only how I feel and my wellbeing, but sharpening how effective I can be in the world is my motivation. Without practice I don\u2019t improve. For me, that\u2019s unacceptable. Being better, doing better, connecting better, that is my goal. Why do you practice? \ud83d\udcf7 @jes.lock"
