I wanted a variable and free practice, a calm and slow Yin or a creative Vinyasa flow. But nowadays it's the opposite. I think there are a few reasons...\n\u2764\n1. I found a good teacher and a good place to learn.\n2. I found Mysore style which suits me very well. (Mysore is a teacher-assisted, self-led approach to practicing yoga asanas)\n3. I love that I have the same routine, same sequence to go through daily. My life is (very) chaotic... everyday is different and it's difficult to have routines. I love that I know my practice well, what I'm going to do next.\n4. Ashtanga gives me a lot of challenges! Endless learning. I\u2019ve already noticed I\u2019m improving and it's an amazing feeling. Like this week when I was able to do something new it gave me so much energy.\n5. Last but most important, the more familiar I become with my asana practice (which happens everytime) The more I can focus on my breathing. It's becoming also more meditative all the time.\n\u2764\nSo never say never. I suggest to give a second opportunity to different yoga styles! \u2764 What is your favorite at the moment? \ud83d\ude0a\n\u2764\ufe0f\nMy art inspiration account @nudeyogagirl_art",

I was a bit shocked after I started reading... houndreds of pages of food diary. Year after year, day after day. I was counting calories, points or carbohydrates etc.\n\u2764\nMany notebooks started with a straigt line, on the otherside was my current weight and on the otherside my goal weight. I measured myself like the modeling world teched me. I marked if I had taken any food supplements or drank enough water, I gave grades to how my day went. I rated my life according to what I ate and my workouts?!\n\u2764\nThe worst thing... there was a photo of myself modeling and some photos that I had cut from magazines of skinny supermodels. I had written next to my photo: I DON'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE THIS. And next to the other photo... I want to look like this, and then there was this \"thinspiration\" photo.\n\u2764\ufe0f\nHow sad. I hated my body for so many years. I was too big, my boobs were too small. I was ashamed of my body, and I was sure everybody looked at me like I saw myself. I controlled my eating for years but only nowadays understand how unhealthy it was.\n\u2764\nI was never diagnosed with eating disorder but now I think maybe I've had at least some kind of orthorexia for a while. After trying to be as skinny as possible I became obsessed of being as toned as I can and I started to aim for muscels at the gym.\n\u2764\nWhy do I want to share this? Because yoga has helped me the most. After finding yoga to my everyday life, I lost my interest in my weight and the measurements of my body. I haven't weighed myself for at least three years now. These things don't define anymore who I am. \"You are beautiful exactly the way you are.\" \u2764\ufe0f\n.\n.\n.\n#yoga #NYGyoga #selfacceptance",

Going to the gym, hill runs on the mountains.Three weeks in Italy. Too much pasta, pizza and risotto. A new yoga mat (do you have a favorite one!?). Listened to two audiobooks. Friends. Visiting Sardinia with my boyfriend. Meeting deadlines - late nights because of them. Spending a lot of time in nature. A lot of environment and climate change talk...Debating about it! One movie night. One concert in a church. Worried about hair loss. Zero clothes shopping.\n\u2764\nWhat comes to your mind if you think about the last 30 days?",

But the feeling is also because there is so much things I would like to learn, do, read, see, visit, try... As an entrepreneur my work never really finishes and I never get bored. It's hard for a bit of a perfectionist when we can't do all the things as well as we would like to. I\u2019ve tried and learned to take tasks less seriously and prioritize also social things. But I still have the feeling that life is too hectic and I\u2019m finding it a bit hard to calm my mind. And I don't have even kids yet! \ud83d\ude0a I think it's not only my lifestyle but my personality type!\n\u2764\nI wanted to ask you: What do you do or think to relax and slow down during busy periods?

I'm anxious and worried about the world situations... Are you too?!\n\ud83c\udf31\nAfter the new report of climate change we all really should start doing what we can. All companies, customers, individuals, everyone... We have only 12 years to limit the climate change catastrophe. We have known for 50-60 years about global warming and still we\u2019ve made the situation just worst.\n\ud83c\udf31\nToday I'm very happy that I\u2019ve decided to keep this account out of materials and commercial products - but I know that travelling is something that I need to reduce. I'm already almost vegan and prefer local food, I don't own car... but still I can do a lot more besides reducing flying: buy less, recycle better, take shorter showers, avoid plastic even more.. etc. I think having a large following gives me responsibility to write about these things more and give an example.\n\ud83c\udf31\nI want to challenge you to do so also!
