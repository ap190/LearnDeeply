My first race suit and helmet, standing at the top of the steps at my parents\u2019 house modeling as my mom took this photo of me showing off my newest gear. I took my then \u201cMicrosoft certified IT guy\u201d work clothes off to put this suit on, but at that moment there was not one thought about me quitting my job. Four years later that is exactly what happened when I made my decision to quit that cushy IT job for my passion. The passion of driving, competing against the best, entertaining, sharing fun and putting smiles on faces all over the world.\nA lot of people ask, \u201care you surprised by your success and the things you\u2019ve achieved?\u201d My answer is, no. I\u2019m grateful, BUT I\u2019m not surprised. I know how much work it has taken to get here, I also don\u2019t have the mindset that \u201cI\u2019ve made it\u201d or that \u201cI\u2019m successful\u201d because all the things I\u2019ve achieved thus far are done and in the past. In my mind, success is relative to the current and future challenges. It\u2019s the next things that get me out of bed and motivated like it\u2019s the first day every day. That mindset is one of the tricks to continued success no matter what you aim to achieve! #myexperience #neverforgetyourroots #thankful"
