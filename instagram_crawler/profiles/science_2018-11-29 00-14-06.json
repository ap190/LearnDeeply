A product of heredity and environment, operative for many tens of millions of years, this three-pound collection of cells is still of virtually unknown potential; yet what a history of achievement and what incredible promise for the future!... No other group of cells sends travelers to the moon and soon beyond, reengineers genes, produces a Mozart sonata or a Turner Landscape. But what\u2019s the most significant achievement of this organ small enough to be held in our hands? I'd say the ability of the brain to change in response to cultural diversity \u2014 with measurable chemical and structural changes. Yea... our brains literally add nerve cell branches in response to training and learning, no matter what our age. Conversely, the brain is learning to reshape the environment in which we live and will both benefit from and suffer the consequences as it does.\n.\n\ud83d\udcf7 Arnold Scheibel, MD\n.\n#science #anatomy #humanbrain #cells #wow #incredible",

The clock has been worked on by researchers at the Institute for Photonics and Advanced Sensing (IPAS) in Adelaide, Australia in conjunction with Cryoclock, and it has been worked on for 20 YEARS. It is 1,000 times more precise than any other commercial system currently available and ticks 10 billion times per second. The \"cryogenic\" in the device's real name comes from the 1,200-carat sapphire crystal that needs to be cooled to minus 267 degrees Celsius (around 449 degrees Fahrenheit) -- only a few degrees above absolute zero. The chief application of the Sapphire Clock would be to upgrade the sensitivity of radar signaling in JORN, an over-the-horizon radar network that acts as an early warning system in Australia's defense capabilities. Said team leader Professor Andre Luiten, \"The sensitivity to detect objects at great distances depends on the purity of the reference clock frequencies. Our Sapphire Clock would allow JORN to generate signals that are 1000 times purer than its current technology.\" #science #tech #clocks #time",

The Tesla CEO readies the fancy propane torch and unleashes a jet of flame that appears to be close to his hight, so potentially six feet and two inches.\n.\nThe Boring Co. sold 20,000 of these rifle-shaped blow torches for $500 apiece, raising about $10 million in the process. That money is supposed to help the firm to continue to burrow tunnels that could one day enable a CROSS-COUNTRY HYPERLOOP \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude85 . They are not \u2014 as the 'Not-a-Flamethrower' name implies \u2014 military grade, or even technically flamethrowers at all. .\nActual flamethrowers use diesel or gasoline to ignite enormous streams of fire that could engulf whole fields. The M2 Flamethrower used by the United States in World War II, for example could shoot up to a 131-feet of flame for up to seven seconds. The Boring Company\u2019s fire spitter is powered by a propane gas canister that induces a fraction of flames an M2 does and that\u2019s because it has to by law.\n.\nFull story on @inverse: https://bit.ly/2ICFfq6\n.\n#science #flamethrower #hyperloop #elonmusk #joerogan #tesla",

Japanese and Chinese astronomers recorded this violent event nearly 1,000 years ago in 1054, as did, almost certainly, Native Americans.\n\nThe orange filaments are the tattered remains of the star and consist mostly of hydrogen. The rapidly spinning neutron star embedded in the center of the nebula is the dynamo powering the nebula's eerie interior bluish glow. The blue light comes from electrons whirling at nearly the speed of light around magnetic field lines from the neutron star. The neutron star, like a lighthouse, ejects twin beams of radiation that appear to pulse 30 times a second due to the neutron star's rotation. A neutron star is the crushed ultra-dense core of the exploded star.\n\nThe Crab Nebula derived its name from its appearance in a drawing made by Irish astronomer Lord Rosse in 1844, using a 36-inch telescope. When viewed by Hubble, as well as by large ground-based telescopes such as the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, the Crab Nebula takes on a more detailed appearance that yields clues into the spectacular demise of a star, 6,500 light-years away.\" For more information on Hubble, follow @nasahubble + check out the link in their bio!\n\nCredits: NASA, ESA, J.

The angiogram here gives us a high-resolution glimpse of the vasculature that supplies each region of the brain. A birdseye view into the very vessels we strive to preserve through diet, exercise, and avoidance of harmful toxins like smoking.\n.\nThree main arteries supply the brain's cerebral hemispheres. The anterior cerebral artery, one of the two terminal branches of the internal carotid artery, runs anteriorly in the longitudinal cerebral fissure between the two brain hemispheres, and supplies blood to the rostral portion of the frontal lobe and mediodorsal aspect of the prefrontal cortex as well as the primary motor/somatosensory cortices. The middle cerebral artery, the other of the two terminal branches of the internal carotid, runs laterally along the base of the hemispheres and provides nourishment to the lateral surfaces of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Finally, the posterior cerebral artery, which arises as the terminal branch of the basilar artery, supports the inferior half of the temporal lobe and the rest of the occipital lobe extending to the somatosensory cortex medially.\n.\nThis anatomy lesson aside (thx, @mdhealthtips!), it's no mystery that our very existence is dependent on the brain maintaining consistent blood flow. What a glimpse into the extended super-highway and Byzantine Conduit that our blood must go through in order to bring vital nutrients to the brain.\n.\n#science #anatomy #angiography #brains #humans",

Spring \u2018Red\u2019 honey is the most sought after, costing upwards of $US15 per kilogram. This demand has resulted in a shift in ownership of the cliffs away from the indigenous communities to the government, allowing them to open honey-harvesting rights to contractors.\nAn influx of tourists trekking the world famous Annapurna circuit has stimulated interest among trekking agencies in organising \u2018staged\u2019 honey hunting events in areas such as Ghandruk, Manang and Lamjung. They charge US$250-$1,500 for one honey-hunting event, very little of which is paid to the indigenous communities. Honey hunters are tempted by this short-term financial benefit to harvest outside of the normal season with tourists using climbing gear to accompany them, damaging the cliff face and nesting sites in the process.\n.\nWith funding from the Austrian government, the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) is addressing problems arising from commercialisation of honey hunting and the impact of tourism through the Himalayan Honeybees project. Coordinators of the project aim to work with traditional honey hunters to preserve their sustainable harvesting techniques. The overall aim is to help communities reap financial benefit from an indigenous resource while preserving a bee species that will ensure the pollination of crops and maintenance of plant biodiversity in the long term.\n.\nFor more stunning imagery, follow our friend @andrewnewey.\n.\n#science #nature #photography #honey #nepal #nature #wow #incredible",

They are moving to the Midwest because it\u2019s experiencing more rainfall, and while the Southeast still gets proportionally more, the rainfall has been decreasing in recent years. In addition, 62% of the species are migrating north to escape the heat. While these migrations might help preserve individual species, it will likely destabilize forest ecosystems.

Details on the \"illumination satellite\" are scant, but Wu said it would be eight times brighter than the actual moon, could light an area 10 to 80 kilometers (6.2 to 50 miles) wide, and that its exact lighting range could be controlled within a few dozen meters. .\nThe satellite would also have a \"highly reflective coating to reflect light from the sun with solar panel-like wings whose angles can be adjusted.\" .\n#science #tech #china #chengdu #moon",

One of them, neoprene, is the biggest culprit of the suit's degradation as, over time, neoprene hardens and becomes brittle. Twelve years ago, the suit's custodians at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. took it off display and managed to slow the degradation process a little, but apparently, because of all of the plastic, the suit is becoming less durable. As of this writing, the Smithsonian has not yet responded about what else its conservators are doing to help keep Armstrong's historic suit from breaking down. #science #tech #space #nasa #moon",

(wait for it)... their thumb!!! \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\ude80 (via brg.com) \"Yesterday, Russian space organization Roscosmos and the European Space Agency broke the news that the International Space Station had sprung a leak. That\u2019s a pretty big deal for the astronauts who are riding what amounts to a floating science laboratory, so when the spacecraft\u2019s alarms began to ring they rushed to find the source of the leak and fix it.\n\nAs it turns out, a tiny meteorite is thought to have struck the space station, leaving a small hole in one of the modules. But what do you do when you see a hole in your high-flying lifeboat? You plug it with your thumb, of course!\" You can read the full story at: https://bgr.com/2018/08/31/international-space-station-leak-meteorite/\n\n#science #space #meteor #news #sciencenews #spacenews",
