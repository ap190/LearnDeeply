Generally speaking, I found my photographic way in relative isolation. I lived in various parts of Africa where, despite there being a few other photographers around, I never felt particularly connected to them. In many ways, this was a healthy and liberating dynamic. I was free to discover and embrace what I liked without the sometimes-deterring influence of other opinions. I used the internet to look at pictures and tried to find my path through near-constant practice. But as time goes on I sense an increasing pull to commune with others. Nights like these feel important.",

Each day, on the upper reaches of Angola\u2019s Cubango River, we encounter large blockages of trees which, over many years, slipped into the river and grew horribly entangled. The knots of thick branches render portions of this narrow river impassable. Each time the team encounters such a blockage, either Kyle or his colleague Kerllen, jump into the water to hack and saw through them. Often, the troublesome branches are under the water, requiring the hand-sawing of thick wood underneath the surface. Brutal. Toss in the presence of crocodiles to ratchet up the discomfort. It's never easy. There's a film about all of this and more, called INTO THE OKAVANGO, which has just been announced as an Official Selection at the @Tribeca Film Festival this year!
