Where there is an abundance of food, wildlife thrives! After experiencing a painful collapse of their herring fishery in the 1970s, Norway has become a leader in fisheries management. Today, there is a beautiful balance between fish, whales, tourism and fishermen. A true example for the rest of the world. #Norway"

As I inch towards 1 million followers, it is crystal clear to me that as the first female photojournalist to get this recognition, I must also recognize my sister warriors; the amazing women who deserve recognition and accolades for their creativity, bravery and perseverance. Their work, like mine is aimed at inspiring and informing and I hope you will be compelled to share their work with your network. I will share the work of 15 amazing photographers and first is my friend Michelle Valberg, one of Canada\u2019s best wildlife photographers and a personal hero and role model.\n*\n*\nOn a remote island near Hall Beach, Nunavut in Canada's Arctic, we encountered approximately 10,000 walrus. Some were swimming and feeding, others were sprawled out on the beach. At the end of our shoot, we were walking back to our boat when we heard this thunderous sound. I turned and instinctively starting shooting. Everything happened so fast. It wasn't until I saw the back of my camera that I realized the magic that had just happened. The walrus were on the move into the water, they had been spooked. All the dust from the sandstone rose from the walrus craze, the sun peaked out slightly from the clouds, I had movement and the perfect storm to create this image. It remains one of my favourite wildlife images from the Arctic to date.\n#walrus #nunavut #arctic #nikonambassador #canada #wildlife #canadianwildife #nature #raw #remoteisland #hallbeach #arcticcanada @stephsinclairpix @amivitale @aprilbencze @jennygnichols @morganheim @jodicobbphoto @maggiesteber @ascullyphoto @melissagroo @estherhorvath @beverlyjoubert @thedanielledasilva"

She is approaching fast and I must confess mixed feelings of excitement and fear as I fight to hold position. The small female swims quickly in between us\u2026.and drops a jellyfish between @paulnicklen and I. A jellyfish?? I have to wipe my mask to understand what I am looking at. The orca then disappears and comes back two minutes later to take back its jellyfish. Then she vanishes again into the dark water. Was this a gift, or perhaps a gesture of accomplishment, or maybe an invitation to play? What was this incredibly smart and beautiful animal trying to show us? I feel genuinely lucky to be alive and doing what I do and I hope that stories like this can ignite your imagination and spark in you the desire to fight with me to protect places like this.

For me, however, the mythical humpback whale holds a special fascination. Maybe it is the comeback story from the edge of extinction; the symbol of hope and resilience personified by a charismatic creature? I am not sure but they too are here, feeding in great, rambonctious numbers and they are beautiful. I hope to see many more humpbacks on this expedition.

To be honest, we were scared by the amount of neglect and damage that we witnessed happening to our oceans and knew that we had to turn things around. We launched The Tide to help fund our vision and mission just one year ago and, in that time, this incredible community has proven to be absolutely critical to SeaLegacy\u2019s work.

But both above and below the surface, that rings true for the Province of West Papua in Indonesia.  Not for much longer, though.  I photographed this young Papuan girl as she played in a forest stream while machines worked in the background to open new logging and mining roads. Even as we whisper with the hope of preserving it, bulldozers and trawlers are working to exploit the rich resources of this remote and beautiful corner of our planet. We can change how the story ends, though. This December we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make sure its protected.

The war paint, the feather headdress, the beautiful bead necklace and arm bands, tell the story of a brave and proud man. This portrait and many others are part of my new book, \"Amaze\". This weekend, I am proud to be offering a special Limited Edition of the book, presented in a beautifully crafted clamshell and including three fine art prints. The perfect holiday gift for a photography lover. Go to the link on my bio to learn more."

In British Columbia we are seeing them starve as herring stocks and therefore salmon stocks, dwindle. But sometimes it is just nature's course. This female orca I photographed in Norway is probably an old matriarch. Who knows how many oceans she has traveled and how many members of her pod she has birthed and mentored in the mysterious ways of the orca. #Follow @SeaLegacy as we explore ways to protect these northern fjords and turn them into a whale sanctuary where old whales can live and die in peace."

Last month, I joined @shawnheinrichs and @bluespherefoundation in West Papua, Indonesia. While there, they presented their new film, \"Provinsi Konservasi\", to audiences across the province, while also engaging key community leaders and influencers in workshops at each stop of the tour. All of this to garner support for the Papuan provincial legislation that would designate the region as a \"Conservation Province.\u201d This media, concert, and community outreach tour directly engaged and inspired more than 25,000 people and resulted in a petition signed by more than 700 local leaders in support of the proposed legislation.\nThe #ProvinsiKonservasi Initiative has the potential to bring about ridge-to-reef conservation of West Papua, setting a new gold standard for regional conservation and sustainable development and creating a blueprint for conservation initiatives that protect Earth\u2019s most critical ecosystems. However, parliamentary leaders need our help to show the other members of parliament that the world is watching. We must deliver!

Imagine if this entire province, covered by the world\u2019s second largest rainforest and housing some of the richest reefs in the globe, was protected?  It wouldn\u2019t just be a win for Indonesia, it would be a win for the world.  Won\u2019t you help us get this to 30,000 signatures?  Click the link in my bio!!

The return of the salmon to the rivers and creeks after their oceanic journey is the heartbeat that powers the people and wildlife on this coast, like this grizzly bear waiting for Coho salmon to go up the stream. But recently, we've seen its pulse weaken; there aren\u2019t nearly as many fish as there once were, or should be. @PaulNicklen and our @SeaLegacy expedition team traveled the coast of BC this year to collect visuals that we hope will inspire dedicated people such as yourselves to maintain the health of this ecosystem."

I felt lucky and honored to witness the smudging of the Tsleil Waututh watchhouse; a space they built to resist the construction of the Trans Mountain pipeline. Today we woke up to the great news of a temporary block to the KeyStone pipeline. This certainly changes the dynamics for the Alberta tar sands and all the pipelines for Canada\u2019s dirty oil that people from all corners of the world are opposing. Resisting matters, and it takes courage, time and resources. It is more important today than ever before, so please don\u2019t give up!

I call all the little voices in my head, the 'Peanut Gallery,' and they are constantly telling me to be cautious, to stay in my comfort zone, to take the safe route. I make a constant effort to silence those voices. They are the voices that tell us that women don't deserve the same opportunities, or that the world is a dangerous place for a girl, or that we don't deserve the achievements we conquer. Whether I am making a speech or diving with large predators, I change my inner-dialogue into a conversation about empowerment. Fear is natural - it's how you use it that counts."

When we worked on this story for @NatGeo, people thought it was a stretch to tie the worsening forest fires to the changes in precipitation brought forth by a warmer ocean. Our planet is changing faster than we are able to understand or prepare for. Anyone still denying climate change, should be held accountable by those already suffering its devastating consequences. #climatechangeisreal #forestfires #horses"

But the influx of palm oil, logging, mining, poorly-planned development, overfishing, destructive fishing, and the illegal wildlife trade are all threatening to irreversibly harm this magnificent place, and the many indigenous peoples that call it home. In the face of these seemingly insurmountable threats, the government and community of West Papua have haven joined together to stand in defence of their natural treasures. The fate of West Papua now rests in the adoption and implementation of revolutionary legislation that would establish all of West Papua as a conservation province.\nTogether, with @bluespherefoundation, @conservationid, and @indonesianoceanpride, @sealegacy is standing alongside more than 700 local leaders and key Parliament members who are committed to making West Papua the world's first Conservation Province, #ProvinsiKonservasi.

I'm working with @raincoastconservation and @coastalfirstnations to permanently end commercial trophy hunting of all large carnivores on the coast of British Columbia, like this beautiful and inquisitive coastal wolf.\n\n@aprilbencze, @tavishcampbell, @karencooperphoto, @colleengaraphoto, @bertiegregory, @melissagroo, @johnmarriot @neileverosborne, @eric_sambol_photography, Andrew S. Wright, Brad Hill and myself are donating prints of the carnivores at risk to raise funds to help protect them. This is mine. These fine art prints will be auctioned at each exhibit: @karencooperphoto gallery in Vancouver, @batemancentre in Victoria, @audainartmuseum in Whistler.\nSee the link in my bio for more information and to bid."
