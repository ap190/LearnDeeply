There\u2019s a lot of warm up before I\u2019m ready to move into the full variation on the left. Hip flexor and hamstring openers, shoulder stretches, spinal mobility movements. There\u2019s no need to do a full split here - it feels good in my body, so I like to take it to my edge, whatever that is at that moment. The strap is such a wonderful prop to assist with the grip. It helps open the shoulders as well as deepen the stretch in the standing leg and frontal hip. I can\u2019t fully straighten my top leg with my hands on my foot, and the strap gives me the space I need to work into the needle shape. \ud83d\udc97 Loving the rosewood color from the @aloyoga holiday collection. \ud83d\ude0a Oh!
