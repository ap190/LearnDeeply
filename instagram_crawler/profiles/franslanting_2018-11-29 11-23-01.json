When he reached this point and became the first person to see the frigid southern coast of the island, he realized it was not the long sought shoreline of Antarctica after all and turned away. But for modern travellers, this stretch of the forbidding South Georgia coastline is an awesome sight.

South America\u2019s giant anteater is designed to eat ants and nothing else. It breaks into ant hills and termite mounds with giant claws and slurps up the tiny insects by the thousands with a long, sticky tongue. Anteaters have no teeth and half of their body length is made up of a giant hairy tail, which serves as a blanket to keep them warm.

To be recognized with so many peers, colleagues, friends and brilliant young photographers In attendance was a moving experience. I was given a wonderful sculpture of a bull elephant. When @ChristineEckstrom examined it closely she realized it was inspired by a photo I had made years ago of a famous elephant named \"Survivor\" in Zambia\u2019s North Luangwa Valley. Survivor lived through a previous poaching holocaust in the 1980s and he was written up in Mark and Delia Owens' books \"Eye of the Elephant\" and \"Survivor\u2019s Song.\" The bull elephants depicted here, which I photographed in Botswana one memorable evening, lived more tranquil lives thanks to its government\u2019s enlightened policy of putting a moratorium on elephant hunting, but even there the tide is turning. I\u2019m sharing this image in honor of all elephant champions including the late Paul Allen, and respectfully ask that you consider supporting the organizations that can turn the current poaching crisis around and secure a future for elephants. Proceeds from a limited print of this image titled \"Twilight of the Giants\" will benefit their cause.

It is the sad outcome of a heated debate about the most appropriate way to manage nature and wildlife in this famous wetland near Amsterdam. For some this area represented a unique opportunity to recreate nature on a scale that had not been seen in the Netherlands, nor anywhere else in Western Europe, in many centuries. But for others the mortality among the horses and the deer after a recent severe winter became too much to bear and they demanded action. After consulting the experts and pondering the options the Dutch government decided that the experimental approach to rewilding this wetland needed to be replaced with a more conventional management of culling the large mammals back to a drastically reduced population. So nearly 1800 deer will get killed and many hundreds of Konik horses are slated to get removed. I realize there are no easy answers for resolving this dilemma, but as a Dutchman living abroad looking at the Oostvaardersplassen with an international perspective I am sad that it has come to this. I hope that this will not be the last chapter in the ongoing debate about the meaning of nature and wildness in the most densely populated country on earth.
