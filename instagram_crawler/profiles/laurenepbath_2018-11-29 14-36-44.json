Number one: I don\u2019t have to wake up for sunrise and number two: there\u2019s just such a chill vibe when you\u2019re watching the sun go down at the beach. Garry and I photographed this amazing sunset at Scarborough Beach with tummies full of delicious food and the sounds of a live band trickling down from the Scarborough Sunset Markets.

This is the Field of Light: Avenue of Honour, although you\u2019ll have to wait until next week for the story as my stories and posts are out of sync. Haha. But this place is incredible and sad and poignant and meaningful. It\u2019s a tribute to the ANZAC\u2019s that departed from Albany for the First World War and it will be on display until ANZAC day 2019, right at the National Anzac Centre in Albany. I was personally blown away to learn and experience everything here at this special place and I hope that some of you make the pilgrimage to this side of Australia between now and the 100 year anniversary of the end of the war. \u2764\ufe0f @WesternAustralia #JustAnotherDayInWA\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#SeeAustralia #WesternAustralia #Australia #ThisIsWA #FieldOfLightAlbany #AvenueOfHonour #FieldOfLights #Albany"

Do you recognize the tents from my first shot of the Gourmet Escape?

Um, did you know there\u2019s an amazing company called Rockingham Wild Encounters that is super close to Perth and offers dolphin swims, sea lion cruises and penguin \u201cfeeding\u201d? (NB/ Only a handful of penguins that are in full time care and not eligible for release into the wild) Sadly we didn\u2019t do the wild dolphin swim this time around but we did get to see the dolphins on our sea lion cruise! I love dolphins \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc2c\ud83d\udc2c @WesternAustralia #JustAnotherDayInWA\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#SeeAustralia #WesternAustralia #Australia #ThisIsWA #RockinghamWildEncounters #Dolphin"

Why do I travel, why do I shoot, why am I here in your lives every single day? For those that don\u2019t know my back story, in my previous life I was a chef. I lived a very small life, a life that had no purpose. Since discovering Instagram, and finding a platform that gave me a voice, I\u2019ve changed fundamentally as a person. I AM a better person, a bigger person and a person that wants to change the world. That WILL change the world. I travel because travel helps me to understand what I need to do. This understanding gives me clarity on my purpose, my legacy. In my life I want to influence others to be better. To ask the big questions, to live big lives and to be f**king passionate about SOMETHING. With our collective passion and energy and clarity and consciousness we can change the world. Thanks to @kerwinrae for reminding me of my power and my purpose."

The town has had life breathed back into it, in the form of the old Grain Mill! The Mill was in complete disrepair, on the verge of being condemned, when it was purchased for the bargain price of $1 and transformed into a luxury hotel. The Premier Mill Hotel is exceptional! Absolutely dripping in history and awash with stories with beautiful rooms and public spaces. I\u2019d highly recommend a couple of nights here just to learn more about our history, our farming industry (where our food actually comes from \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) and the small towns that are the back bone of Australia. And if you need any further convincing, the best wine in Australia last year was produced in this region! \ud83d\ude0d @WesternAustralia #JustAnotherDayInWA\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#SeeAustralia #WesternAustralia #Australia #ThisIsWA #Katanning #PremierMillHotel #GreatSouthernRegion"
