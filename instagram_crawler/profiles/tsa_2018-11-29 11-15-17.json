And if you are packing for your holiday flight, you might be debating how to handle canned items, such as pie filling and cranberry sauce. Fear not... we've got an answer.\n-\nMost canned food items either contain liquid (think green beans for that casserole), or they have a gel (looking at you, cranberry sauce) or creamy consistency (such as that pumpkin pie filling). That means you'll need to stuff them in your checked luggage. -\nSo please don't put canned items in your carry-on bag. We don't want your goose to be cooked when you arrive sans ingredients!\n-\nAnd if you've got questions on other food items, reach out to our #AskTSA team on Twitter or Facebook. You can write them a message or send a photo. They're available 8am-10pm on weekdays, and 9am-7pm on weekends and holidays... even on Thanksgiving Day!\n-\n-\n-\n#travel #traveling #traveler #airport #traveltips #tsatraveltips"

Leave large containers of liquids at home, or place them in your checked luggage. You can find information on other prohibited by checking out the \u201cWhat Can I Bring\u201d search feature on our website.\nAlso, reuse existing bottles. Place an empty container in your carry-on bag. You can fill it with water after the security checkpoint, or find a recycling bin inside the terminal.\nFinally, if you can\u2019t find a recycling bin in the airport, you can newspapers, bottles, cans and containers in your luggage to recycle once you arrive at your destination.\nLet\u2019s all do our part to make the planet a better, healthier place!\n-\n-\n-\n#TSAEarthDay365 #recycle #recycling #greenliving #travel #traveling #traveler #airport #traveltips"

A TSA explosives specialist or a police department bomb squad must respond before the bag is ever opened. This can lead to costly evacuations, delays, and missed flights. These types of items can also lead to hefty fines and arrest. Contact your preferred shipper about your options, because they can\u2019t travel via commercial aircraft. So even though they aren\u2019t real, they can cause a lot of very real headaches.\n...\nAs for the \u201cF\u201d, after long and careful thought, we\u2019ve determined that it must stand for Fred. This must have been Fred\u2019s novelty bomb. It was discovered in a carry-on bag at the Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC)."
