That time is a healer. One year ago on the 25th of August \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d perpetrated by the Burmese military sparked the world\u2019s greatest refugee crisis. Now nearly a million Rohingya, those who escaped the flames and executions, are living in camps in Bangladesh. Many of these survivors were raped, most saw loved ones killed, thousands arrived wounded. All are traumatized. Here, in this impoverished monsoon soaked corner of Bangladesh, is the most densely populated area of PTSD affected and depressed people on earth. Here, time has not healed. For the Rohingya, the psychological scars remain painfully open.\n-\n#inmyworld is designed to expose the challenges faced by people living with #mentalhealth issues and give them the chance to be seen, heard and valued. @witness_change is a nonprofit that aims to improve life for excluded groups by amplifying their stories. This work was made in collaboration with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res @doctorswithoutborders who are providing mental health support to the refugees and local population.

She knew there was a risk of contracting HIV, so was not completely surprised when she tested positive. Shame kept her from telling anyone. Fear, of being found out, kept her from going to the clinic for medication. Her brush with death dramatically reshaped her perception of the illness. Despite the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS in her country, she has become open about her positive status using it as a platform to encourage other LGBTQI+ community members to practice safer sex and get tested. // In Mozambique more than a third of gay men and transgender women have HIV, but, because of stigma, many don\u2019t have access to care.

Her story is horrifically typical. After encircling her village, the Myanmar military started burning houses. They went house to house and shot the men, including Rohima\u2019s husband. Five months pregnant and in shock, Rohima held her four-year-old to her chest, and her screaming six-year-old to her side. A soldier marched forward, picked up the distraught child, and threw him into the burning flames of a house. The screaming stopped. Somehow, through the tears and choking smoke, Rohima managed to slip away and into the jungle. Her four-year-old and unborn child were safe. but Rohima\u2019s world was shattered.\n//\nOne of life\u2019s greatest misconceptions is a simple fable. That time is a healer. One year ago this week \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d perpetrated by the Myanmar military against the Rohingya sparked a massive refugee crisis. Nearly a million Rohingya \u2013 those who escaped the flames and executions \u2013 are now living in camps in Bangladesh. Many of them were raped, most saw loved ones killed, thousands arrived wounded. All are traumatized.

The little girl in this photo is wearing a top with characters on it from the Disney movie Frozen. She and my nieces in New Zealand love the same film, but how different their childhoods have been. As European ministers meet today to fight over who will be toughest on those trying to come to Europe, I hope they realise who they are talking about - little girls like this, who deserve the same potential futures offered to my nieces in a safe country free of bombs and blood and the smell of death.\n-\nMoria overflows with refugees and their desperation. Inhuman living conditions and a snail-paced relocation process can drive the already traumatized towards depression and suicide - mental health issues that haunt a people with no home.

It has been announced that her colleague, 24-year-old Hauwa Mohammed Liman, a health worker, who had been abducted in March was killed by her captors. Another health worker abducted at the same time, Saifura Hussaini Ahmed Khorsa was killed in September. A third is still held captive. The ICRC made sustained and committed efforts to secure the release of the health-care workers, including a last-minute plea for mercy on Sunday to the Islamic State West Africa Province group, to no avail. // Nafisa is familiar with the violence that has rocked the region. She works in a specialist gunshot and bomb blast wounded ward set up and run by the ICRC in the State Specialist Hospital in Maiduguri. Everyday she stitches wounds and plugs gaping wounds of men and women who\u2019ve experienced first hand the destructive force of sharp exploding metal. // Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. While living with and reacting to those consequences, women are hardly passive victims, though. They grieve, they fight against the suffering, and many find they are forced to re-invent themselves, shedding an old identify and forging a new one shaped by war. // This work was supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross, a humanitarian organization working on all sides of conflict to alleviate people\u2019s suffering.

A look back at work I made in Lagos, Nigeria: Sand dug from the bottom of Lagos Lagoon is used to reclaim land and to make the concrete blocks many of the city\u2019s houses are made from. Much of that sand is dug by hand. These are sand miners who dive 4 \u2013 5 metres to the bottom of the lagoon and, one bucket at a time, fill the boats powered by wind - propelled with sails made of rice sacks. My fixer regularly risked his welfare while working with me in Lagos - but coming out on the water on these stitched together boats was too much of a stretch - he stayed on shore.",

I had heard about homophobic laws and read the reports from human rights group condemning them, but rarely did I hear from the targets of this discrimination. Believing that people can be moved when they come to know survivors of abuse, I thought photography and storytelling might contribute towards creating a connection that might lead to action.\nMost of Where Love Is Illegal's stories have been of difficulties faced. But many also have been of great resilience, and love found, despite massive challenges. Recent work made in collaboration with The Elton John Aids Foundation was no different - stories of terrible suffering, but also of incredible courage and of love. Of course, it should never have to take courage to be with the person you love, but in many many places around the world, for hundreds of thousands of people it does.\nWe\u2019ll be sharing our new work at @WhereLoveIsIllegal. Please follow along.\n-\n\u201cWe are a gay couple, we are a couple together for almost 4 years, like a common couple we have gone through many problems, but love has always spoken louder. I do not regret anything. If I had to go back in time and do something different, I would not do anything different. I would do everything the same.\u201d\n-\nIn Mozambique, where Neston and Avelino are from, more than a third of gay men have HIV, but, because of stigma, many don\u2019t have access to care. New hope comes in the form of a program that will test thousands for HIV, as well as train LGBTQI+ people to test their peers confidentially and in their own homes.\n-\nWhere Love is Illegal traveled to Kenya, Mozambique and Ghana with the support of Elton John AIDS Foundation (@ejaf @ejafdn). Around the world, grants made by the Elton John AIDS Foundation make possible the work of countless community-rooted organizations that touch the lives of millions every day.

Where stigma and discrimination thrive, HIV infection rates amongst vulnerable LGBTQI+ soar.\n-\nThe furs and beads Avelino wears are unmistakably African. He struck a flamboyant, feminine pose for this photograph. That\u2019s why I love this image - it is proof that there does not need to be tension between homosexuality and 'African values.\u2019 What it doesn\u2019t show though is that Avelino is HIV positive. He told us about first finding out: \"It was scary, I did not expect it.\u201d He said. He told us he contracted HIV because he didn\u2019t really understand the risks. This is not unusual in countries where LGBTQI+ communities are isolated. In Mozambique more than a third of gay men have HIV. New hope comes in the form of a program that will test thousands for HIV, as well as train LGBTQI\uff0b people to test their peers confidentially and in their own homes.\n-\nWhere Love is Illegal traveled to Kenya, Mozambique and Ghana with the support of Elton John AIDS Foundation (@ejaf @ejafdn) to continue our work sharing LGBTQI\uff0b stories of survival and to raise awareness of the impacts of stigma. Around the world, grants made by the Elton John AIDS Foundation make possible the work of countless community-rooted organizations that touch the lives of millions every day.
