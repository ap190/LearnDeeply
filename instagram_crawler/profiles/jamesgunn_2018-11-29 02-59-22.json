On our fifteen minute drive to dinner we had already discussed our thoughts on marriage, having children, and psycho exes. As we entered the restaurant, while we were waiting to be seated, we discussed the deaths of loved ones in our lives. Intimate, honest, casual discussion was the natural energy between us. I didn\u2019t know @jenniferlholland\u2019s place in my life by the end of the evening, but I knew she was very different from anyone I had every known. Today, she is a part of my life and family in every way. Love you, Jenn! Happy Anniversary to us! #\u2764\ufe0f"
