I haven\u2019t showered today nor washed my hair in 10. I also haven\u2019t gone to the grocery store in weeks and #confession, I\u2019ve been living off frozen French fries and a bag of dried cranberries all week.\n\u2800\nMy laundry is piled up (clean but not put away... I\u2019m not sure it ever gets put away. We kind of live off the top of the basket \ud83d\ude02! Am I the only one?) and my dishwasher just broke, so I\u2019ve been avoiding that part of the house hoping somehow the dishes will clean themselves.\n\u2800\nMy kids however, are clean, fed, and homework is done, so I consider that #winning at the Mom thing today. Do you agree?\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc66\u200d\ud83d\udc66\n\u2800\nI may be tired and feeling overwhelmed, but I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. I love my family and I also love working. Maybe if I didn\u2019t work the house would be cleaner and everything would be \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc, but then I\u2019d have no need for this post\ud83d\ude09. \u2800\nPS: Tomorrow I\u2019m filming for my Playbook App! If you subscribe, send me a message here or in the app and tell me what you\u2019d like to see! Annnnnd....

If you don\u2019t find her funny, something might be wrong with you.\ud83d\ude01\n\u2800\nShe\u2019s shy yet open and shares her awkward moments which makes her so lovable. She is an artist and feels everything on a deep level which I not only relate to, but it makes her someone I love to follow. Somehow I know if we lived close to each other, we\u2019d be the best of friends.\n\u2800\nInstagram can be sometimes full of people trying to get \u201clikes\u201d by showing more than they should or doing things just \u201cfor the gram\u201d but Erin is just Erin and I love that.\n\u2800\nIf you are looking for inspiring content that makes you feel something, check her out. @erintron \u2800\n#repost @erintron \ud83c\udfb6 Song: Walls | @kingsofleon"

In fact, most of my life, I felt marriage was nothing but a system of control and would only eventually hurt you. I was lucky enough however, to marry an alcoholic who found recovery. Yes, lucky... extremely blessed beyond belief.\n\u2800\nI talk about this from time to time, but around the holidays, I know it can be really hard for some who may not have come to terms yet with their or someone else\u2019s disease of addiction.\n\u2800\nI have addiction in my family (who doesn\u2019t, right?) and yes, I also married someone who suffered from this progressive, horrible disease. It steals people\u2019s lives away - in plain sight - and everyone blames the victim. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just stop?!\u201d That\u2019s what I use to think until I also got help for my part in the disease. It took some deep inner healing and education to understand this monster of a disease. To this day, finding recovery was the best thing I\u2019ve ever done or will do for the rest of my life. I\u2019m so grateful to God, and for those who helped me along the way. I am also so grateful for my husband, who just celebrated 10 years of sobriety! \ud83c\udf89 He is my best friend, my boo, my carpenter, my fixer of all things, my provider, and the best father I could have asked for to my 2 sons.\n\u2800\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing in this photo\ud83d\ude02, but my husband looks hot \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude0d, so I\u2019d like to honor him today.\ud83d\ude09 He is my walking miracle and proof that \u201cit works if you work it!\u201d\n\u2800\nI love you, baby!

I get it, I\u2019m brave because society tells us we need to hide that stuff, but it\u2019s not very brave in my opinion. It\u2019s just honest and maybe that\u2019s why people call it brave. Let\u2019s all be brave, ok?\n\u2800\nThere was a bit of an argument over whether or not #veganism is healthy and \u201cruining the planet\u201d. Also, some comments on how vegans are judgmental - to which I can honestly say that I felt that way before I was a vegan\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\n\u2800\nI couldn\u2019t stand vegans. I felt they were always judging me and I thought they were so preachy. But, after I became one, I saw their heart. I saw their compassion to end animal suffering. I saw how much they just wanted to save innocent animals from living a life of agony. I felt how much love they had in their heart & I understood why I felt judged. It wasn\u2019t personal it was just passion.\n\u2800\nI am not here to tell anyone to do anything or live any certain way. I\u2019m just sharing what works for me.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb I don\u2019t judge you for not being vegan or anything else that I believe in that you don\u2019t. We can still be friends, I promise. I think some (not all) #vegans need to remember that the same compassion they have for animals will work on humans ... or at least let non-vegans know that some of us vegans are really cool people.\ud83d\ude0e \ud83c\udf31 \u2800\n#Vegan #plantbased #letsgetalong"

This was a really interesting drill to see the subtle differences in strength vs flexibility on each side of my body.\n\u2800\nUsing a #resistanceband changes the stretch to make it more active and the muscles respond SO much better when you give them #strength combined with #stretch! It\u2019s also a really good drill for anyone who is working on the vertical line in #handstand. I stole this idea from @tditty2 \ud83d\udc95\n\u2800\nMy training programs are for anyone looking to strengthen their core, work\nhandstand or to learn yoga - they are available on my Playbook app! Subscribe today! Don\u2019t wait for the new year! ALL LEVELS! \u2800\nLink in profile!\ud83d\udd17\n\u2800\n#getstretchy #flexible_people #fitover40 #fitmommy #nevertoolate #bygcoredrills"

I\u2019ve done harsh drugs like Acutane & tried every acne medicine know to man to no avail.\n\u2800\nI will share what I\u2019ve done - not saying this will help anyone but simply what has helped me.\n\u2800\nA little over 2 years ago, I decided to go Vegan. I got rid of all dairy and meat products and found that had a huge effect on my skin. Unfortunately, I was eating a lot of processed foods (not really knowing how to do the vegan thing) and noticed that if I had too much soy or corn, I\u2019d break out. I began drinking water about 6 months ago like crazy - which really helped but I was still having minor breakouts. Then about 2 months ago I rediscovered @medicalmedium & celery juice. I began drinking it every single morning on an empty stomach. This had the biggest effect on my skin. I immediately noticed within 2 days how fast my acne cleared up. Since then, I\u2019ve been figuring out what is going on in my gut. What foods create inflammation & what foods feed the Epstein-Barr virus that I believe is the cause of my #Fibromyalgia. I have tried to stay away from all processed food & only eat real food - plants grown in the ground. Nothing from a package. Yes, this is very hard to do and no, I\u2019m not perfect at it. I struggle when I\u2019m starving, but it\u2019s doable when you have lots of fruit in the house.\n\u2800\nI also began eating 2 apples a day and 2 (if I can) bananas a day. I eat high alkaline fruits ALL DAY LONG. I feel like this was the key (along with all the rest) to really helping my skin and my fibromyalgia.\n\u2800\nI\u2019m not a nutritionist, but I know that all the toxins/viruses in my body feed off acidic foods.\nBasically (if I understand properly) I\u2019m starving them by eating foods that are the opposite and the #fruit helps my liver to flush them out.\n\u2800\nI have been doing a slow colon #detox from @alkalineveganshop which has also really helped. I\u2019ve paid for all these products & this is not a sponsored post. I just want to share because I know how it feels to hate your skin. \u2800\nMuch love!\ud83d\udc95\n#nofilter #nomakeup"

It seems like there is just so much more to do and so little time to do it all. There also seems to be so many more people out on the road and in stores that it makes everything harder.\n\u2800\nFor me, it becomes very stressful no matter how hard I try to appreciate and enjoy it - the tree, decorating, holiday parties, shopping, wrapping, and mailing gifts...\n\u2800\nI\u2019ve tried to say no to it all but my husband likes it, so I do my best to smile through it.\ud83d\ude01\n\u2800\nAnnnnnd... is it me or does it seem like people are way more sensitive and easily aggravated this time of year? #stirsupcrazy\n\u2800\nSo are you someone who loves this holiday season or are you more like me and wish we could just skip it?\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\u2800\n#holidaylove #santaclaus\ud83c\udf85 #cartwheel #yoga #handstandpractice"

She asked if her hamstrings were too tight or her hip flexors too weak. I asked her to try this wall pike and float down.\n\u2800\nThis drill lets you know if it is your #flexibility or your strength.\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udd25\n\u2800\nIf you feel this in the #hamstrings, then it\u2019s a good indication that they might be too tight to hold the position. If you feel it in the #hipflexors/#core, then strength is needed. If you feel heavy and can\u2019t find the #float then working on just holding the position and pushing hips back will help strengthen the muscles needed. Spend a good 30 seconds to 1 minute here to build up the strength!\n\u2800\nRemember to engage that #TVA (see my last post) and press the ground away! Look between your hands and notice how far back the hips have to be - this is the same position needed to eventually press up!\n\u2800\nI have a handstand program on my playbook!

I\u2019m pretty sure, ever will.\n\u2800\nSince then, I\u2019ve lost the desire to reach certain physical goals other than being healthy and strong. I\u2019m either unmotivated or my motivations have changed. Either way, I\u2019m happier now. Isn\u2019t it funny how each year we sometimes change into completely different people? Growing older is pretty cool, I must say.\ud83d\udc95\n\u2800\nhttps://playbook.app.link/kerri-verna\n\u2800\n#wednesdayvibes #handstand #fitmom #lastsummer"

Once a week I will share my best tips and practices for training and learning handstands.\ud83e\udd38\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\u2800 \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb Follow this tag #handstandclinic \ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffband leave me questions on these posts of what you are struggling with. I\u2019ll do my best to help you\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb!\n\u2800\nFor today\u2019s #HandstandClinic drill we are working on #forearm and #core strength with L #handstand wrist taps. In order to gain control over your handstand, you need both forearm and core strength. This drill addresses both! This intermediate drill will be especially hard for anyone with tight shoulders or limited core strength, but I promise if you work on it, you will become solid and strong in your handstands! Want to try? Tag me in your posts if you do!\n\u2800\nTAG a friend\ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, bookmark the post, and don\u2019t forget to leave me questions in the comments!

                        "comment": "The deep abdominals or the transverse abdominis (TVA) is a hard muscle to target. A lot of times people focus on the more superficial muscles of the obliques or the rectus abdominis when \u201cactivating\u201d their core, but the key to stability, whether it be in a handstand or just daily life, is the TVA.\n\u2800\nIf you don\u2019t intentionally focus on engaging it, the surrounding muscles can take over, and although you are \u201cstrong\u201d, you end up with back pain or you can\u2019t do things like press handstand even though you feel \u201cstrong\u201d enough to do it.\n\u2800\nThis is a very simple exercise laying on your back. Relax your breath and keep your pelvis in neutral. Then, lift and squeeze the pelvic floor (like a kegel exercise) as you draw the navel into the spine. The key is not to move your hips and to think of a girdle pulling you in.\n\u2800\nI gave a demo on my live today if you want more info! I also have core training and yoga classes on my Playbook App! Link in my profile.\ud83d\udd17\n\u2800\nTag someone who needs to know this!\n\u2800\n#healthyback #spinehealth #tva #transverseabdominis #deepabs #coreworkout"
