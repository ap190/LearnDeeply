                        "comment": "Why did I come to LA, you ask? I never really loved this city and I never thought I would spend more than a layover here, but when the alternative was to stay in the fetal position on my couch wallowing in Thai take-out and leftover champagne (that I not so mistakenly stole a case of from an event I hosted) I booked the first flight out of there regardless of the destination - it didn\u2019t matter where I was going, it just mattered that I was.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFrom the outside looking in I suppose I\u2019ve spent the last 6 years running - toward what I am not so sure but from what I can be certain. \u201cmundane\u201d defines itself as \u201clacking interest or excitement; dull.\u201d And dare I say it, that word and the definition of it are terrifying. TERRIFYING. God forbid you should feel, even for a minute of your life, like it is mundane (after all we only have 39,420,000 of those suckers in the average lifetime - make them count). \u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis break up was a long time coming. It crept up like a death eater in the night, circling around Hogwarts and sucking out the happiness before it sucked the life out of me. I wasn\u2019t sure who I was anymore or who I wanted to be - I don\u2019t even think I cared beyond what show was next for my rotation on Netflix (side note I can highly recommend Atypical, The Good Place, American Vandal and of course, Stranger Things). But wait WHAT. Life inside a box - a system for transmitting visual images - was more exciting in that moment than walking out my apartment door.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFast forward a few months and I\u2019m learning to make friends with these feelings - to let uncertainty wrap me up in endless possibilities and knowing that \u201canything can happen\u201d is a blessing not a curse. It\u2019s the first thing I think when I wake up and the last thing I ponder when I consider what adventures I\u2019ll embark on the following day.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTo be uncertain is to be open to anything. To be unsure is to recognise that the more you learn, the less you know. There\u2019s a bumper sticker that says \u201cNo matter where you go, there you are.\u201d There\u2019s no wrong or right to where you are geographically - we all still sleep and wake beneath the same sun and moon. \ud83c\udf1b\u2728"

I\u2019ve been here, in the real world, hangin out in Los Angeles and meeting some really interesting Uber drivers from all walks of life - many of which try to pitch me their art or ideology and I\u2019m totally down with the dinner conversations I can take from that.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIf you\u2019ve been here a while you know the whole spiel: girl travels world, girls finds self, girl finds boyfriend, girl lives happily (n)ever after on a farm in Tasmania. But no it didn\u2019t end like that.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSharing your life online as a blogger is opening yourself up to comment & criticism but being a human with feels, know that I haven\u2019t disappeared for a wanting to do so, but slowed down on sharing the day to day while I figure it all the hell out \ud83d\ude43 (spoiler alert: still not figured it out. But here to share that uncertainty for the lack of conversation around it on instajam.)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSo I moved to Los Angeles a couple months ago and a couple days ago decided it\u2019s time to leave. There\u2019s a little ol\u2019 city by the name of New York with my name on it (for now).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nOver the next week I\u2019m opening up my adventures of the last 2 months in Los Angeles here and in stories because boy have I had some fun. It has been so nice to take a break offline and do the real world for a while - and frankly, it should be okay and normal to take a break from posting pretty photos. It is weirder to me that I would post pictures of my \u201cperfect\u201dly adventurous life when really it has been a lot of crazy characters, myself included, just cruising through the uncertainties of your 20\u2019s like it\u2019s a 1980\u2019s teen comedy.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSee you soon with more thoughts and commentary from the wild world that is LA :)"

Your enthusiasm is ultra high, you lose a round, and you (well, I did) throw the controller to the floor and find a new activity to keep you occupied \u2019til your mum announces food has hit the table.\n\nBeing in Los Angeles after a break up meant two things: I could go out and kiss whomever I wanted (which I often did) and I could do nothing career-wise for a solid two months without anyone, including my parents and dear friends, asking how long I was going to keep up this act.\n\nMy kissing boys and pretending to be interested in them hit a peak when I was invited by a boy (actually a man 10 years my senior) in a leather jacket to a wine bar on the East Side. It was 8pm - one of those \u201cis this pre-dinner or is this post-dinner?\u201d times to invite someone out for drinks. I was hungry (always) which I voiced (always) and he proclaimed \u201cthere\u2019s a great Oyster Bar downstairs\u201d. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him I was a vegan - I just figured I would drink more wine and engage in good conversation so he would forget all about the prospect of venturing downstairs to eat Nemo and all his friends.\n\nDrink wine I did, however this crucial fact is precisely why said boy did not receive a second date. Leather jacket boy had invited me to a wine bar and excluded the precursor that he a) does not drink wine and b) does not drink alcohol at all (so he said matter of factly). It\u2019s not that I have anything against non-wine-drinkers (jk I do if we\u2019re gonna DATE), but wouldn\u2019t a virgin juice bar have been less awkward? I drank myself into oblivion thinking about it that night, left when I said I was going to the bathroom and got caught out as I tried to depart through the Oyster Bar below, forgetting we were perched atop a balcony overlooking that very street.\n#LAMems"

I booked a hotel in Hollywood and thought \u2018oh my lucky stars\u2019 I\u2019ve booked a bargain. *Great location* were the words that hooked me. The price being at least half of all other options was what led me to hit the \u201cbook now\u201d button. The hotel looked nothing like the photos but it was in the precise location it said it would be: Hollywood. For an Australian visiting for the first time I thought I had hit the jackpot - that was until the guy who checked me in drew me a map of which streets around the hotel to never walk on and which streets to only walk on during complete daylight. \u201cNo streets\u201d he told me \u201care safe after dark\u201d. He was erring on the side of caution and most of my experience in Hollywood was good fun. I caught the bus and the metro and despite seeing some really weird stuff, I think it was only weird to my naive-lived-on-an-island self who had not yet been exposed to such things. I don\u2019t think my mum is ready for Hollywood - yesterday was day one so we\u2019ll give her a few days to warm up. I took her to this street instead and showed her a lovely time. It\u2019s my favourite view of the Hollywood sign and it\u2019s exact location is on Windsor Blvd between 4th and 5th. #LAmems"
