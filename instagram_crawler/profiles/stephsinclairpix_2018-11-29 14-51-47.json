Since her husband, Indra, - the sole family breadwinner - was taken into ICE detention 10 months ago, Risma Fadersair has been managing to care for her four children on her own. Two of the four are special needs, with autism and Down syndrome. I get nervous when Bryan leaves town for one week and I have to take care of my two on my own. I am humbled by her strength and determination. Kudos on NY Magazine and the Marshall Project for taking on this issue so thoroughly. See the full story here : https://nym.ag/2LtNo42"

Although illegal under Indian law, human trafficking remains a significant problem. According to @apneaap, a nonprofit which works to end sex-trafficking by preventing inter-generational prostitution in India, there are currently 16 million victims of sex trafficking in the country. India\u2019s Lok Sabha passed the Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill earlier this year, criminalizing and penalizing trafficking for exploitative sex, forced and bonded labor, begging, surrogacy and forced marriages. However, UN human rights experts say is must be revised with victim-centerd approach rather than criminalizing survivors, potentially further harming already vulnerable individuals. @canonusa #women #girls #trafficking #survivor #beauty #color #hope #change #canoncpsusa #canonexploreroflight"

Just weeks before, Gerlane lost her only pair of glasses down a well and was in a panic. Her father, a farmer, tried to fish the glasses out\u2014to no avail; he later wept recalling the effort. This left Gerlane unable to do many things she loved, including reading to her sister at bedtime. Fortunately, her family heard about a mobile eye care clinic coming to a nearby village\u2014an opportunity for a free eye exam and glasses\u2014and made arrangements to travel there, an hour by boat. \u2022\nI was thrilled to join @OneSight, an independent nonprofit, as they hosted their first-ever, fully digital, eye clinic in the Amazon. More than 2,000 patients traveled to the clinic during a five-day boat expedition to bring better vision to a remote and underserved area. \u2022\nToday, on World Sight Day, I share this story in celebration of those who work to bring global attention to blindness and vision impairment and provide for those who lack access to vision care. // @OneSight found a way to reach them and provide more than clear sight. Watch for today\u2019s story @natgeo and check out the link in my bio to learn more."

Because of her small stature, Baby needed a cesarean section to safely give birth to their son, Joseph. While child marriage is a critical issue in both crisis and stable contexts, the rates of girls married underage is rising at alarming rates in humanitarian settings according to Girls Not Brides. \u2022\n\nToday is the 7th annual International Day of the Girl Child. In honor of this important day, I collaborated with my friend, fellow photojournalist and AP photo editor @mayaalleruzzo MayaAlleruzzo on a story she published titled, \u201cAP PHOTOS: Growing up Female Across the Globe.\u201d Poverty, violence, and cultural traditions oppress millions of girls in every part of the world. It is still a global struggle to have girls valued for more than their bodies \u2014 for just their sexuality, fertility and labor. Today we come together to help galvanize support and inspire the international community to do its part to establish, expand and protect girls\u2019 rights so girls are free to determine the course of their own lives. It\u2019s also a time to celebrate girls in every way, which is long overdue.
