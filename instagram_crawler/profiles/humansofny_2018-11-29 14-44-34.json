My friends and I were going to a golf tournament the next morning, so we wanted to get some sleep. But at the last minute we decided to grab a quick drink. My buddies were doing their thing, so I decided to take a lap around the bar. And I noticed one girl that was just glowing. I\u2019m pretty sure that she was sitting right under one of the bar lights. I just had to go for it. I walked right up to her. I said something like: \u2018I want to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you.\u201d After that I was grasping at straws. I kept trying to find a common denominator. But the best I could come up with was that she was in the same sorority as my friend\u2019s cousin. Somehow we ended up talking for the next fifteen minutes. The bar was so loud that we had to lean in to talk to each other. At one point we actually touched cheeks. And my buddies are gonna tear me apart for this, but I just remember thinking that she had the softest face. I gave her my number at the end of the conversation. I wasn\u2019t really expecting to hear from her. But the next day she told her mom the story, and her mom said: \u2018Give him a call. You don\u2019t have to marry him.\u2019\u201d"

Whenever my father was home, I just locked myself in my room and tried to be as quiet as possible. My mother and I finally escaped when I was six, but the abuse stayed with me. I didn\u2019t make any friends at school. I couldn\u2019t trust anyone. It was an open wound. But when I was fourteen, my mom told me that we could do something about it. She asked me if I\u2019d be willing to testify. And I agreed. The trial happened two years later at my father\u2019s military base. I hadn\u2019t seen him in ten years. The lawyers told me I didn\u2019t have to be in the courtroom when I testified, but I felt like I needed to face him. Just to show that I wasn\u2019t afraid anymore. He was already seated when I walked in the room. I put my hand on the Bible and looked right at him. For a moment, I felt a stroke of fear wash over me. Like I was a kid again. But I set it aside and gave my testimony. It felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. I\u2019ve moved on with my life. I don\u2019t think about him. I\u2019ve grown to look like him, but I\u2019m not him. Even if someone tells me I\u2019m him-- I\u2019m not him. I\u2019m me. I\u2019ve lived my entire life to not be him.\u201d"

But in my neighborhood, we opposed the government by breaking into houses and robbing people. But in 1994 we were told: \u2018Democracy is coming. Apartheid is ending. It\u2019s time to learn a trade.\u2019 So I listened. I did everything I was supposed to do. I\u2019ve worked in construction for the past twenty-five years. I started my own company. I followed all the procedures. But nothing has come of it. The government always talks about empowerment. They make a big show of letting small businesses compete for contracts. But the jobs always get awarded to the same few people. If the government gave me work, it would empower me. Then I could empower other people. I could hire employees and teach them plumbing, and carpentry, and cabinets. I could purchase a brick making machine, and hire women to mix cement. But right now I can\u2019t even afford a printer for my office. Everything is hand to mouth. I had high hopes when apartheid ended. But I\u2019ve been building houses for twenty-five years, and I\u2019m still living in a shack.\u201d (Johannesburg, South Africa)"

But my leash has been so short lately that it feels like an eternity. Part of me definitely died when our daughter was born. I was always a free spirited person. I traveled a lot. I never had a boss. I had all the choices in the world. But a lot of that disappeared in order to make things possible for my daughter. I watch her during the day. And I\u2019m not mad about it. This is the happiest time of my life. It would be great if my daughter was here right now. It\u2019d be so fun to watch her run around the park. But I\u2019d also be worried about her safety. And the diaper bag. And the car seat. And the stroller. And our next meal. And our next place to stay. There\u2019s always a flickering flame of worry that doesn\u2019t go away. Back home we live by the beach. And if my wife ever senses that I\u2019m getting overwhelmed, she tells me to go jump in the ocean. And that resets me for a few days. It\u2019s all I need. I just need a little space to be me. Because it can be so easy to get lost in helping a new person become someone.\u201d"

We never talked much in college, but we became good friends when we reconnected at a reunion. The event was eighties themed. There were a lot of Talking Heads cover songs, and we danced all night. After that we started talking every day. Even though we live on different coasts, we\u2019d find different ways to connect. He\u2019d create scavenger hunts for me. He\u2019d send me on missions to find obscure books and records. And we began making mix tapes together. Both of us come from research backgrounds, so we take our mix tapes very seriously. MMTR is our acronym for the meaning of music: \u2018Magic, Meditation, Therapy, Reunion.\u2019 So there\u2019s a lot of MMTR mix tapes: \u2018MMTR I,\u2019 \u2018MMTR II,\u2019 \u2018MMTR III,\u2019 \u2018MMTR 80\u2019s,\u2019 \u2018MMTR 90\u2019s.\u2019 Then there\u2019s \u2018Clan McJangle,\u2019 which is nothing but Scottish Pop. Then we\u2019ve got another called \u2018Buzz Gems,\u2019 which is nothing but guitar songs under three minutes that alternate decades as you go down the playlist. Our mix tapes hold us together. Lately we\u2019ve been working on a business together. And if we ever get too frustrated, we just put on our headphones, choose a mix tape, and hit play at the exact same time.\u201d"

It can be difficult for start-ups to get funding in South Africa, so I\u2019m trying to build a platform that connects investors and entrepreneurs. I\u2019ve been working on it full time for about a year now. But the idea hasn\u2019t taken off as quickly as I\u2019d hoped. Don\u2019t get me wrong-- I\u2019m still on the grind. I\u2019m still having meetings and trying to put together deals. I\u2019m telling myself that no matter what, I\u2019m going to figure this out. But if I\u2019m being absolutely honest with you, it\u2019s not looking promising. I\u2019ve got about two or three months of runway left. The bank has been calling me every day because of the credit card. And my car just broke down, which will probably eat up twenty percent of my remaining reserves. My options are running out. It\u2019s a lot of pressure, but I\u2019m trying to focus on the bright side. I made it a whole year. We built the initial platform and had a few users. And I\u2019ve moved forward as a person. I\u2019ve gained a lot of new insights. I\u2019ve grown my network. Experienced people have told me that I\u2019m working on an important problem. And that validation means more than money. So even if this particular business fails, I\u2019ll try again. But next time I\u2019ll come back at a better angle.\u201d (Johannesburg, South Africa)"

While I was repairing his shoe, we heard glass shatter. And we saw three guys running away with his laptop computer. I chased one of them down, caught him by the shirt, and began to beat him. I made him call his brothers and tell them he was about to be killed. Sure enough, they brought back the laptop. So I let him go. But the police came to my store the next day, and told me that I shouldn\u2019t have taken matters into my own hands. They said next time I\u2019d go to jail. But what am I supposed to do?

They\u2019re always spouting sound bites from their favorite cable channel. It\u2019s so boring. There\u2019s no creativity. Nothing but sound bites. Then on Election Day, my newsfeed is filled with people posting smug pictures about how they voted. Like it really matters. In the end, the people with money are still going to be calling the shots. Nothing matters. But I guess it makes people feel like their life isn\u2019t meaningless if they\u2019re spouting off on Facebook. I hardly ever post anything. My profile picture is Uncle Sam and my cover image is an eagle shitting on him.\u201d"

I want to forget about my day. I don\u2019t want to listen to his loud voice. And I don\u2019t want him standing in the kitchen when I\u2019m trying to cook.

I\u2019d have to drop out for a few weeks, and since flying involves so much muscle memory, it would take me a while to get back on track. So one day I bought a stack of magazines and newspapers. I went through every page and cut out the advertisements. Then I opened my pantry and wrote down every brand I could find. I sent all of them letters, asking for help. Almost everyone said \u2018no.\u2019 But I did receive an amount from a grocery store called Pick-n-Pay. And Breitling sent me a brand new watch to raffle. That was a huge break. I sold six hundred raffle tickets. Things were going so well. African Pilot Magazine promoted the raffle for free. A man from Australia bought 100 tickets. But then I got a letter from the Lottery Board ordering me to end my raffle. They said it was illegal. I tried to explain that I was raising money for my education, but they didn\u2019t care. I was so disappointed. I\u2019d have to sit out another year of flight school. But when I called everyone to explain the situation, nobody would accept their money back. They told me to keep it! It was enough to keep me in the air for months. Then around Christmas that year, one of my mentors invited me to eat lunch at the airport. When I stepped out of the car, everyone who had ever helped me was there. They all started clapping. And somebody handed me the phone. A person on the other end said: \u2018You\u2019re live on 94.7, and we\u2019re going to pay for your entire education!\u2019 That was nearly four years ago. I just got my license last week. My plan is to fly for South African Airlines, but first I want to do some teaching. I want to visit schools in black neighborhoods. I want all the kids to see what an African female pilot looks like.\u201d (Johannesburg, South Africa)"

And for a while I had an identity crisis. I felt like my skin was too dark and my build was too muscular. Other kids were telling me that I looked like a boy. I got bullied a lot. I didn\u2019t have any friends. I began to feel depressed. Then one weekend I got invited to a party at a boy\u2019s house. I was excited to go. But when I got there, it was nothing but drunk people. Everyone was passing around a joint. And when it got to me, the boy said: \u2018Trust me, you\u2019ll love it.\u2019 So I tried it. And I did love it. Next thing you know, I was going out every weekend. I started drinking heavily. I was high all the time. My grades began to drop. But I was also getting cooler. I was never alone anymore. I was hanging out with popular people. We all hyped each other up, so it was easy to ignore the consequences of our behavior. But whenever I was alone again, I felt like I didn\u2019t know myself anymore. I was heading down the wrong path. That\u2019s not how I was brought up. So I had to get conscious. I had to be honest about what brings me happiness: writing poetry, reading books, and sometimes being alone. I backed away from the party lifestyle. I became more selfish with my time. The other night I ran into a few of my old friends, and they were a little mad because I hadn\u2019t been around. They said I was acting like I was above it all. But that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m just at a different stage of my life.\u201d (Johannesburg, South Africa)"

So I think he was hoping I\u2019d end the pregnancy. He claims I took control of his life by keeping the baby. He\u2019s not the type of person to abandon his child, so he thinks I forced his hand. At first it seemed like he was going to make the most of it. He told all his friends about the pregnancy. He took me out to eat. We had a little vacation. But that changed quickly. There was no stomach rubbing. No asking how I felt. He started going out a lot, and stopped kissing me goodbye. Our son is seventeen months now. We still live under the same roof, but that\u2019s about it. There\u2019s no physical intimacy. Very little communication. He\u2019s always great with our son. They play together and have a great time. But there\u2019s no \u2018three of us.\u2019 We never go anywhere together. Or if we do, the conversation is awkward and surface level. I try talking to him. I tell him: \u2018If you hate me or resent me, just let me know.\u2019 But he says: \u2018Quit forcing things. Let it become what it\u2019s going to be.\u2019 But it\u2019s been eighteen months and it hasn\u2019t become anything. He never wants to talk about our relationship. I know that I should leave him, but I just don\u2019t have the courage. I keep hoping something will change. Because I always wanted the experience of raising a child together.\u201d"

I started winning competitions. And I got hooked. My boyfriend didn\u2019t like it. He thought it made me less desirable. But the worse our relationship got, the more I focused on working out. It just felt so great to be recognized for something. I was really, really good at it. And the bodybuilding community is so great. They\u2019re some of the least judgmental people because they\u2019re used to being judged all the time. For the first few years I was really self-conscious about my body. But I\u2019ve gotten to the point where the small comments don\u2019t really bother me anymore: \u2018ew,\u2019 gross,\u2019 \u2018disgusting\u2019-- things like that. I can usually block people out if they can\u2019t type more than a sentence. But occasionally the criticism sinks in. It still hurts when people question my gender. Or my sexuality. And I\u2019ve had some awkward Tinder dates. The last guy said: \u2018Holy fuck, you\u2019re bigger than I thought you\u2019d be.\u2019 But despite all this, I\u2019ve gotten comfortable in my own skin. I actually feel more feminine now than I did growing up. I was always skinny. I never had breasts. I didn\u2019t ever feel like a natural woman. But what is natural? Is make-up natural? Or botox? Or fillers? Or breast implants? All of us are flawed. My mask might be different than other people, but we all hide behind something. I just hide behind my muscles.\u201d (Johannesburg, South Africa)"

I think it was called \u2018Gums and Noses.\u2019 I cleaned the toilet, swept, made tea\u2014 things like that. All I ever got was money for transportation, which was fine for me. I just wanted to be on a film set. But with two weeks left of filming, there was a bit of a disaster in the camera department. A trainee blew up an HD monitor by plugging it into the wrong hole. Which was a shame, but it was great for me because I always wanted to be a cinematographer. When I heard them say they needed a replacement, I raised my hand and said: \u2018Me, me, me!\u2019 So that\u2019s how it started. And it never stopped. The camera department can be a weird place. It\u2019s all white and male. And it\u2019s a bit like boot camp. A lot of the guys are mean. They don\u2019t like being approached by subordinates. And if you make a mistake, they\u2019ll scream at you. A lot of the guys act like they\u2019re curing cancer instead of making beautiful pictures. But I had thick skin. So I moved up quickly. Recently I DP\u2019ed one of the most popular shows in South Africa. And I run my department a little differently. It\u2019s much more chill. I think we should all share our knowledge. Nobody should be afraid to make mistakes or feel embarrassed to ask questions. And one trainee should always be a girl. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s studied or not, as long as she\u2019s keen.\u201d (Johannesburg, South Africa)"

I tried to switch over to the clothing business. I knew how to sew, so I decided to give it a shot. But things are even worse than before. I can stand here all day and not get a single customer. I\u2019ve been at it for three years, and I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m still making an effort. I should have a wife by now. And a house. And kids. But I have nothing. How can I meet someone when I can\u2019t even provide for myself? Recently I fell in love with a woman. She sells food around here. We used to talk every day and night. We bathed together, and slept together, and prayed together. She\u2019d give me smiles and kisses. I didn\u2019t have much, but I gave her what little I had. For once I was finally happy. Then she came over to my house one evening, and saw that I didn\u2019t have anything. No radio. No television. Nothing. And she pretended like everything was OK. She acted like it didn\u2019t bother her. But two weeks later she broke off contact. She never said it was because I don\u2019t have money. But it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have money. Sometimes I think I should just kill myself.\u201d (Johannesburg, South Africa)"

They\u2019d look for kids with potential and give them scholarships to dance school. They visited my school in third grade. And I guess they saw something in me, because they provided two free ballet classes per week. I didn\u2019t really like it at first. But one night I went to see The Nutcracker, and it inspired me to become a dancer. I enrolled in a serious ballet school, and by the age of thirteen I was dancing five days a week. Then six days a week. The school started to get really competitive as we got older. Everybody wanted to be a soloist. Kids would come to the school from all over the world. Some of them were \u2018bunheads.\u2019 All they did was dance and watch tapes. But most of us were more balanced. Ballet is extremely rigid, so if you have the opportunity to have fun, you take it. I started drinking a lot. And doing a lot of drugs. It was hard to hide. I\u2019d come to class late and tired. I ended up dropping out of regular high school. The dance school never approved of that decision, but I always hated studying. Personally I don\u2019t think I ever lost my edge. I was just driven in ballet and partying at the same time. They kicked me out of the school when I turned twenty. I knew it was coming, because that\u2019s the age when you either go to college or join a dance company. But neither of those were options for me, so I just quit completely. That\u2019s when the dancing stopped. But the partying kept going.\u201d"

My mother is African but I grew up in France. In high school I went on a humanitarian mission to provide health and education for a village in Senegal. There was no water. There was no electricity. We visited a small orphanage where the children had to beg for their food every day. They had no choice, because if they came back with nothing, they didn\u2019t eat. I cried myself to sleep that night. And when I returned to France, I felt guilty for everything: for living where I live, for having a family, for growing up in a rich country with education and healthcare. I didn\u2019t tell many people about my experience. I didn\u2019t want it to seem like a trophy. And I was aware of the irony because France colonized Senegal. But that trip opened my eyes to the opportunities I\u2019d been taking for granted. It made me appreciate the choices that I have in life. And since those choices are a privilege, I want to use them to help other people.\u201d (Johannesburg, South Africa)"

I got my first job as a cleaner. The boss ordered me around for months. But when it was time to pay me, he refused. It left me in a desperate situation. I was hungry. I needed shelter. So I got frustrated. Some of my friends were stealing cars at the time. They had a special key that could open doors. At first I didn\u2019t want to get involved, but they were living the life I wanted. They had nice cars. They could afford to buy drinks. So when they asked me to come along one night, I agreed. I told myself: \u2018If I just go along once, I\u2019ll be alright.\u2019 We stole three cars that night. Everyone got away but me. When I saw the police lights in my rearview mirror, I started crying immediately. I knew my life was over. I spent a few years in prison. That\u2019s where I met a social worker named Ms. Palesa. She was near retirement. And when she heard my story, she invited me to come work at her house when I got released. I painted for her. I cleaned. I worked in the garden. Not only did she pay me, but she treated me like her child. She bought me clothes. She encouraged me to learn a trade. Ms. Palesa only lived for a few more years, but she set me on the right path. Every friend that I stole cars with that night is either dead or in jail. But I work every day, and I never committed another crime.\u201d (Johannesburg, South Africa)"

I remember looking out the window at all those big ass planes coming in to land. My aunt could see that I wasn\u2019t interested in the paperwork, so she took me to the crew room. I noticed all the pilots had incredible posture. All their hats were lined up on a shelf. Their jackets were all hanging in a row. And that\u2019s when the bug bit me. I started spending all my holidays there. The pilots were very nice to me. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d ever seen an African female who was so enthusiastic about becoming a pilot. They gave me advice and let me share their simulator time. When I turned eighteen, I visited a flight school and picked up an application. But the costs were too much. My mom said we didn\u2019t have the money, and told me to apply to normal universities. She\u2019d bring me applications, but I kept hiding them under my bed and telling her I got rejected. I found an internship with a glider company, and used my stipend to buy my first pilot\u2019s uniform. I put one stripe on the sleeve\u2014for students. When I came home that night, I think she took me seriously for the first time. She could see her daughter really wanted to fly.\u201d (Johannesburg, South Africa)"

My boss\u2019s voice would be the first thing I heard every morning. He\u2019d phone me at 5 AM, asking \u2018Have you done this? Have you followed up with that?\u2019 He\u2019d put me down. He\u2019d shout at me during meetings. I can tell you the exact type of tile in the office because I spent so much time looking down. And I wasn\u2019t allowed to grow. I wasn\u2019t allowed to do anything on the creative side. I could only handle the budgets. Once I asked him if I could leave early one day to take a course in art direction, and he said: \u2018What makes you think you could succeed at something like that?\u2019 That\u2019s when I finally quit. I freelanced for a while. And the more distance I got from the job, the more I realized that I\u2019d allowed myself to be pigeonholed. I wanted to do something creative. I started trying to save money to attend the New York Film Academy, but it was so expensive that I decided to put all that money into gear instead. And for the past couple months, I\u2019ve been making short documentaries about people. I\u2019ve made about twenty of them so far. I let the person use the video however they\u2019d like. I\u2019m not sure what will come of it, and I\u2019ve only got a couple months of savings left, but for the first time in my life I feel like I\u2019m using all of my talents. And I\u2019ve never had this much fun.\u201d (Johannesburg, South Africa)"
