(look it up in your database!) and i love my friend lacey who is a wonderful track super star and is an inspiration but... i\u2019m not sure why you\u2019ve been suggesting i wanna follow more track and field people for the past year. running is not an activity i\u2019m all that fond of and i definitely don\u2019t wanna watch other people do it all day! oh but the animations section is cool!! (but... i kinda already follow most of those folks. have any other neat people doing neat things? should i send you a list of accounts i just adore and we can start from scratch?!?) hope to hear back. thanks for listening, joel.",
