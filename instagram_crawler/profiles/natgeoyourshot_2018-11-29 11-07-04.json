Or rather my great pilot friend, Haraldur Diego (@volcanopilot) surprised me by flying over without telling me in advance. It was hidden by the snow blanket, but a rainbow patch gave it away and the view was spectacular. The \u00d3f\u00e6rufoss Waterfall (approximately 120 meters in height) is on the Nyr\u00f0ri-\u00d3f\u00e6ra river that flows into the great Eldgj\u00e1, or Canyon of Fire.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cWhat an awesome surprise from your friend! This is a spectacular view \u2014 I love the inclusion of the snow, the patterns it creates in the aerial perspective works well with the other shapes and colors in this landscape.\u201d \u2014 @natgeoyourshot Producer David Y.

Since then, the biomass has seen an increase of nearly 450%, with a return of some species which hadn\u2019t been seen since the 1980\u2019s.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cThis scene is awesome. I love how they are making this turn in unison, my eye follows them to the dark spot where they are heading. I bet this was so amazing to witness in real life.
