We headed out to Pyramid Lake for sunrise and the water was like glass.\nCombine that with the beautiful colours and you have the recipe for a great shot.\n\u2014\u2014\nOne of the hints. Have found here in Jasper is that you seem to have all of these beautiful spots to yourself.\nGotta love Alberta!\n\u2014-\n#myjasper #travelalberta #explorecanada #canada"

You can be in the countryside in 2 hours.\nBut for now we are enjoying the bright lights of Tokyo.\nIt offers incredible views over the city but it also makes for a great subject, especially when it is lit up, form many different spots around the city.\n\u2014\u2014\nWe got to explore many different areas of the city but we will be back as there is so much more that we want to do.\n\u2014\u2014\nSony A7RIII\nZeiss 16-35 f/4\nF/11\n30 seconds\n\u2014\u2014\n#tobujapantrip #japan #tokyo #tokyoskytree #tokyoskyline"
