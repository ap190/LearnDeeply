Each time I visit him and his wife Sheila (who just turned 90) in Florida I wonder how long their heath will last. But my grandparents are always there, painting new pictures, reading new books, cooking custom pancakes, straightening out our flat brim hats and enlisting us to help with some facet of modern technology (we set up Netflix for them this time). ~\n\nBefore Thanksgiving dinner this year Grossi (my nickname for my grandfather) began vomiting and gracefully excused himself not allowing anyone other than his wife help. When we got back hours later I sat with him on the couch they have had since I lived on their rural Massachusetts farm as a two year old. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t remember my own children but I still remember you at that age. Running around with the animals, getting lost on the property and causing trouble\u201d - he commented, eating oatmeal my grandma prepared to calm his stomach.\nI guess it\u2019s simple things that keep us going.\n#family #memories #happiness #longevity #life #thanksgiving ~ see story highlights for more on my grandfather... @irving_troob @nathan_shushansky @independentenough @jshushansky @ishusha. ~ [@sonyalpha a7riii with the 90mm Gmaster Macro 1/60 F8 iso 1000 - wifi transferred and edited on the phone in @lightroom]"

Beginning Saturday 24th through Sunday 25th, they\u2019ll be at the Creek Pasture group site, handing out bags from 8-10am through the weekend. Come by, grab a bag and some gloves for your crag/wall/trail day, and drop it back off between 4-6pm. Then share a cold one, some treats from generous sponsors, stories, and hi fives. Thank you!"
