As solo artists I have photographed both jellyfish and brittlestars many times, but I have only seen this unique double act once. It appears that these freeloaders not only hitch a ride, but also actively \u2018steal\u2019 planktonic food scraps from right underneath the jellyfish\u2019s tentacles. How do you think these seabed/coral reef dwelling brittlestars actually get into/onto these pelagic drifting jellyfish? Please leave your ideas/theories in the comments. I will post what I think is the most likely scenario in next few hours. Unpublished photograph from my 2014 @natgeo magazine story \"A tale of two Atolls \""

The tranquil feel of this image belies how ferocious the conditions were at the time. Gale force winds and horizontal rain mixed with ice pellets were the order of the day. I became more and more frustrated with trying protect my lens from the rain and eventually I gave up...deciding to make the droplets on the glass a feature of this photograph. A year later, sitting comfortable in dry and warm conditions I can\u2019t imagine this image without its \u2018signature\u2019 raindrops on the lens.

Masirah Island sits in the Arabian Sea, 20 km off the coast of Oman and it is a place I have very fond memories of. Its\u2019 friendly and hospitable people, the \u2018free range\u2019 camels roaming the streets and one of the densest and most important loggerhead nesting grounds in the world are still forever imprinted on my mind. On a early morning beach patrol we came across a female loggerhead turtle returning to the ocean after nesting. I crouch and wade into the surf zone to make this image just before she dives under a wave and disappears into her ocean home.

Te Tara Koi Koia lies incredibly exposed at the mercy of the wild southern Ocean and landing is only possible on a handful of days every year. It took 27 days of waiting on a sheep farm on the main island (thank you Bruce and Liz for your hospitality) until finally a gap appeared on my very last day. With the help of many Chatham Islanders we managed to get on and off Te Tara Koi Koia safely with 100 kg of camera gear. A heartfelt thank you to the traditional owners for granting me and my @NatGeo team access. This video was shot and edited by my fantastic assistant @ottowhitehead The @chatham_taiko_trust is a pioneering local grassroots conservation organization and my work in the Chatham Islands would not have been possible without their support and guidance. Please follow @chatham_taiko_trust to experience more of one of the wildest parts of our planet."

Moving into deeper seas off the reef edge is probably too risky as bigger sharks like great hammerheads pose a threat to the smaller reef sharks. For me...it is the storm building on the horizon that completes this image, adding energy and drama to the frame. There are few places left in the world with inshore shark populations as healthy as those in the waters around this remote #Seychelles atoll. @sif_seychelles"

This month I showcase the @niassalionproject // Colleen and Keith Begg have spearheaded carnivore (lions, honey badgers, leopards, wild dogs) conservation and filmed/photographed in northern Mozambique for 17 years. Working together with local people, Mozambican scientists and government agencies they have dedicated their lives to the Niassa National Reserve and the people who call one of Africa\u2019s last wild places home. There is no one more deserving of your Instagram love than @niassalionproject So please follow them and learn more about their inspiring conservation efforts. The video shows just 2-month old African wild dog pups which they filmed just a few hours ago at a den site deep inside the Niassa National Reserve."

So for a slight change of pace I thought I would post this image of a juvenile Northern ELEPHANT seal. // This is a marine mammal with a conservation story every bit as fascinating and harrowing as that of its\u2019 terrestrial name sake. Northern elephant seals came dangerously close to extinction in the 19th century, hunted and killed for their blubber which was turned into oil for lamps, lubricants, soaps and candles. By 1890 just a single group of less than 200 individuals was known to have survived the two centuries of slaughter! Conservation measures were introduced in both Mexico and the USA in the 1920s and while recovery was initially slow, by 2010 the global population was estimate at well over 200,000 animals. // We humans have a bad track record of destroying our planet\u2019s biodiversity, but we have also shown that we can turn the tables on extinction if we choose to. While Northern elephant seal numbers are still increasing, the poaching of African elephants for ivory has resulted in populations continuing to plummet. Before European colonization Africa may have been home to more than 20 million elephants. In the 1970s that number declined to 1 million and in 2014 there were only around 350,000 Savannah elephants left. Sobering statistics indeed, but if elephants seal can rebound from 200 to 200,000 then surely there is still hope. The combined efforts of conservation NGOs, scientists, governments and the local people who share landscapes with elephants can still successfully halt the declines and usher in a era of elephant recovery. If you want learn more, here are a few great organizations that focus on the many different facets of elephant conservation @savetheelephants @africanparksnetwork @elephantswithoutborders @biglifeafrica @eiaenvironment @wildaid @r.e.s.c.u.e @dswt @tusk_org Please feel free to mention any other reputable organizations that I forgot in the comments below. #worldelephantday #elephant #elephantseal #pup #conservation"

The \u201cclassic\u201d fish in a puffin\u2019s beak image eluded me for almost a month, until I visited a Atlantic puffin colony beyond the Arctic circle. As the North Atlantic Ocean warms, driven by climate change, the puffin\u2019s favorite prey, sand eels migrate further and further north. Now out of range of the majority of the region\u2019s puffins, this lack of fish results in the few chicks that do hatch frequently starving to death. Fortunately the youngster provisioned by this more northerly nesting adult has a better chance of surviving.

Often the simpler a shot looks the more complex its inception, which is the case for this nighttime whale shark photograph. First the location; Djibouti, sandwiched between Somalia and Eritrea is not really on the beaten path (4 flights) and photographing there can be a bit complicated due to active military operations to counter piracy and terrorism. Personally, I loved Djibouti, the vibrant marine realm, the harsh beauty of desert and the hospitality of the people. Back to photography: What looks like a simply natural moonlight underwater image, is in fact the result of using a hulking movie light hung just above the ocean\u2019s surface off the back of a Dhow. The natural light from the moon was simply not powerful enough to illuminate the whale shark, no matter how high I pushed the ISO setting on my camera. Then there was the waiting... over two weeks I probably spent more than 24 hours drifting in the ocean in near darkness waiting for whale sharks to swim through the beam of light. #djibouti #africa #sharks #nightscape"

The absence of fish in its beak after the day\u2019s hunt is a discouragingly common sight. As the Atlantic has warmed in recent years, sand eels, the puffin\u2019s principal fish prey, have moved out of range to the north. Along with other threats, the change of climate has taken a heavy toll on puffin populations across the North Atlantic.

He called them \u2018Imps of Darkness\u2019 and subjected them to experiments that included repeatedly throwing them back into ocean to find out how long they could withstand the icy cold waters. This experiment of course sounds utterly outlandish by today\u2019s standards, but bear in mind that in Darwin\u2019s time children still worked in factories, women could not vote, surgery was carried out without anesthetic and your barber was also your dentist! I personally am positively obsessed with these unique marine reptiles. On assignment for @natgeo in the Galapagos, I shot more than 20,000 photographs of Darwin\u2019s Imps and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate for a second to go back and shoot 20,000 more. #islandlife #godzilla #darwin #iguana"

For some of those years I was gone for 300 days and the act of getting from A to B via D and G, often with mountains of gear was frequently filled with more frustration than inspiration. However there were exceptions and at times the journey itself was as photographically fruitful as the destination. On the 5 day drive north from Cape Town to Namibia\u2019s Skeleton Coast the road often passes in close proximity to some of the Namib desert\u2019s iconic sand dunes. During a short detour to the west, in the direction of Sossusvlei the wind picked up dramatically, suspending sand and even small pebbles. On the canvas of a quickly disappearing road the wind-whipped, ever-shifting columns of sand reminded me of Peringuey's adders, a snake that uses distinctive sidewinding locomotion to traverse the dune fields of this, the world\u2019s oldest desert. For me, this image captures both the beauty and harshness of this unique part of the world all at the same time. @natgeo #namibia #africa #roadtrip #landscapephotography #journey #namibdesert"

Sometimes a ladder is really inexpensive tool (less so in my case, since I had to fly it to the remote Indian Ocean atoll of Aldabra) to obtain a different point of view. This proved to be the case on assignment for @natgeo in Seychelles a few years ago, when the ladder helped me create the opening image for this story. I have posted that particular photograph before, but I will post it again tomorrow for reference.\nAldabra has the highest concentration of blacktip reef sharks I have ever experienced. The sheer abundance of sharks there is completely out of this world. At low tide they congregate in a small lagoon on a reef flat where a brisk current bathes them in cooler well oxygenated water. They avoid the deeper water off the reef edge where bigger sharks may prey on them.\n\nTime lapse video by my assistant and talented videographer @ottowhitehead"

There are not many places in the world where a scene like this unfolds and even fewer where it can be photographed. Images like this may look whimsical, but they are rarely lucky or surprising finds. In fact almost all of my photographs are the result of copious amounts of research, and for some @NatGeo stories I read in excess 500 scientific papers and speak to dozens of experts before I even head out the door. Lankan is a reef in the Maldives where clownfish live in unusually close proximity to so called cleaning stations, where mantas approach the reef to have parasites and dead skin removed by small fish (mainly wrasses). I spent a few dives searching for the right spot and then did at least five more at the same location to line up the clownfish and the mantas together. #maldives #manta #clownfish #coralreef #indianocean #underwaterphotography @mantatrust"

Memorable... for photographing the worlds only truly ocean going lizard underwater was both surreal and unforgettable. Frustrating... because the wave beaten rocky point where the iguanas graze on algae was also home to two big Galapagos sharks that had not read my shotlist. My aim was to make a photograph that would feature both iguanas and sharks prominently in the frame. When the water was clear the sharks were shy, staying just out of sight. However every 10 minutes or so an extra large set of waves would roll in and turn the ocean into a frothy white soup, reducing visibility to just a few feet. Only then did the sharks become bold and \u201cswitch on\u201d sneaking up on me in the murk, often just turning a arms length away. Unable to see the sharks coming, I was unable to line up iguana with sharks to create the photograph that was in my head.....and the moment the water cleared enough for me to shot, the sharks instantly retreated into the background. So in essence what I am posting today is a photograph that did not live up to its full potential. A unfinished image that could have been so much more...but wasn\u2019t.

The water in Baja California's San Ignacio lagoon is usually a murky green and photographing the gray whales that come here to mate and give birth, underwater is usually very tricky. I spent almost a month working this lagoon for the 2017 @natgeo magazine story \u2018Baja\u2019s Ocean Stewards\u2019 and only for a short, but very memorable 45 minutes I hit the jackpot. The tide pushed in beautiful clear blue water and I had more curious whales around the boat then I knew what to do with. @maresmexicanos. #Baja #mexico #whales #conservation"

On a underwater pinnacle known as El Boiler, mantas gather to be serviced by so-called cleaner fish that remove parasites and dead skin. Many of the mantas here have a curious disposition, hovering just inches above my head, seemingly enjoying the feel of my SCUBA exhaust bubbles tickling their bellies.
