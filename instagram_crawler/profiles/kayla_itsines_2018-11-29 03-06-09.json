These are just things I've noticed helped, so hopefully they help you on your next trip!! 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Buy travel tablets. You dissolve these in water and they are full of vitamins, minerals and electrolytes for hydration! 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Drink WATER!! If it's cold, drink warm herbal tea (non caffeinated) 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Water for your skin is also important (I break out when my skin gets dry) You need products that will keep your skin hydrated 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Bring good walking shoes!! 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Research amazing food places in that country BEFORE you go there so you don't end up eating junk food on the run 6\ufe0f\u20e3 Get a massage! Planes are horrible sometimes, look after your body by giving it a good stretch out! 7\ufe0f\u20e3 Stay off your phone! Put your phone away and enjoy the moment 8\ufe0f\u20e3 Travel with your own pillow (and spare pillow cases) 9\ufe0f\u20e3 Go for 30 minute walk when you land, this clears your head and may reduce your jet lag \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9bwww.kaylaitsines.com/app"

This is because caffeine is a stimulant that increases adrenaline production within in the body, which is what you are trying to keep at bay. So try swapping those daily cups of coffee with decaf, peppermint tea or even an apple. Staying away from caffeine also means cutting out black tea, soft drinks, pre-workouts and too much chocolate. Be mindful of what you are putting into your body, as it truly does have an effect on your stress and anxiety levels.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3Talk To A Friend\nSometimes when you are feeling very stressed, your problems can seem overwhelming and you just want to shut yourself away from the world. Talking about your problems with someone you trust can help you to rationalise and work out what it is that is triggering those feelings so that you can avoid these in future.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3Focus On Deep Breathing\nThis is a really great exercise for anyone who feels overwhelmed and stressed out. If you find yourself drawing up short on air and your chest constricting, focus on deep breathing. Find a quiet space and take a deep breath, counting to three on the way in and then three again on the way out. Really focus on clearing your mind, if you find your thoughts are racing and you can\u2019t turn them off, say the numbers slowly in your head as you are breathing. Repeat this ten times and really focus on slowing down your breathing, nothing else.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3Schedule 30 Minutes Daily For Relaxation\nIf you find yourself climbing into bed stressed and your brain can\u2019t switch off, make a conscious effort to schedule in 30 mins for relaxation daily. This can be in the form of a walk, yoga, meditation or just a quiet drive to your favourite location listening to your favourite music.\n5\ufe0f\u20e3Have a Hot Epsom Salt Bath\nTry taking a hot, soothing bath with some epsom salts. These contain magnesium sulfate, which can help to calm your nervous system and promote relaxation. You could also add some lavender essential oil as this is a calming scent which help put you relax and prepare your body for sleep \ud83d\udca4 www.kaylaitsines.com/app\n\nSource: Unknown."

I got sand EVERYWHERE, it was hot, uncomfortable and just not my thing. I absolutely LOVE walking at the beach (on the concrete walks ways haha) but I can\u2019t say I love a beach workout! I like to be in a temperature controlled environment with loud music and all my equipment around me!! How do you ladies workout?? www.kaylaitsines.com/app"
