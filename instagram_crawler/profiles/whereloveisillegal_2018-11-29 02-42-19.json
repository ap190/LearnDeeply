See their work in our story and support @witness_change to continue work like this by donating at the link in our profile.\n//\nOn #GivingTuesday we are raising money to help groups who struggle to have their voice heard tell their own stories. @WitnessChange believes stories should come from the community, not be about the community. To accomplish this we have hosted three storytelling workshops in 2018. In these workshops participants from the community have learned visual storytelling techniques to show us the world they experience. The images and video they create show a perspective outside media could never see. In 2019 we will run six workshops...but this can only happen with your help. Each week-long workshop costs $5,000 to run. We currently have a budget for just two. We hope that on this Giving Tuesday you can help us achieve our goal of of creating stories that come from the community.",
