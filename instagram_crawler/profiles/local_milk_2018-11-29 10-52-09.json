It has some decidedly NOT fall colored table inspiration (orange was never my thing), and a recipe for my new favorite holiday recipe / all the time party starter / breakfast bowl topper: Jammy Eggs with Homemade Kewpie Mayo & Furikake! Click the link in profile to join my table & steal my recipe while you're there!\n\ud83d\udcab\nGratitude is the name of the game this week (and every week around here), and I've been thinking a lot about the different ways in which we can let gratitude escape us, in the good times and the bad. Because as any sensible person knows whether you have a million dollar business or you're just barely scraping by you are equally capable of being perfectly miserable or perfectly happy in either scenario.\n\ud83c\udf81\nWhen we have plenty\u2014good health, loving relationships, time & money\u2014we run the risk of taking it all for granted. Of falling prey to the voices in the world (and they are legion) that demand we want more, more, more. Which is why even in the good seasons of life, it's critical we practice gratitude.\n\ud83c\udf29\nAnd in the stormy seasons, it's easy to be blinded by the areas that are going wrong. But even in death, in illness, and in loss, we have the choice to choose hope & joy. To choose gratitude. To change the negative tapes playing in our head. Gratitude is always there for the taking. And it will transform your entire world.\n\ud83c\udf08\nToday, I'm grateful for my healthy, happy beautiful Eulalie. A working marriage with @matthewlud (like a working farm...this marriage doesn't just sit there looking pretty...it's real, beautiful work). A career I love and the ability to work and travel at the same time. And YOU, my friend. This whole thing would be nothing without you. Head over to the link in profile to read the whole blog post, see my table, and get the recipe! And let me me know in the comments: What are you grateful for?

That's right! The @rawmilkpodcast is back in action. Just click the link in profile to listen to the latest episode and head over to the @rawmilkpodcast feed for daily inspiration and motivation to make your dreams (like, for instance, calling your bedroom your office! \ud83d\ude2c) a reality!\n\u2728\nThrough the bumps & bruises to our heart during the normal course of life we develop fears that don't serve us. Fears based on false beliefs. I chose today's topic because I know exactly what that feels like.\n\ud83d\ude48\nAfter a 4 month break, I became intimately acquainted with the fear of starting again. Negative thoughts swirl. So you procrastinate on starting that business, that blog, that YouTube channel, that Etsy store, that podcast...You make excuses. And you never start. You don't try because if you don't try you can't fail. Many brilliant people never break past this wall.\n\u26a1\ufe0f\nThe difference between people who make it and people who don't is not whether they fail or not. People who make it fail MORE than people who don't. Because they step out in fear, into the unknown, and try. And get up and try again.\n\u2728\nAnd that's what it is to be brave. You don't expect fear to go away entirely. But you jump anyway. And in today's episode I'll teach you how. If you love the episode, share some love in the review section on iTunes and follow @rawmilkpodcast here on Instagram to help us climb the charts after my sabbatical! I do the podcast weekly for 100% free and your reviews, likes, and comments are what keep us going! If I know I'm helping people, that's all the motivation I need! So tune in and join me in saying my favorite four letter F word (you can guess that one!) to my least favorite four letter F word, fear! \ud83d\ude02 #ff \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#communityovercompetition #creativebusiness #creativepreneur #girlboss #rawmilkpodcast ##passionpassport #mytinyatlas #takemethere #alwaysgo #livemoremagic #theartofslowliving #calmversation #bedeeplyrooted #mompreneur #creativespace #createtoexplore #createeveryday #createcultivate",

The only thing to change is your eyes, and to change your eyes you have to go inside yourself. What I hope for you today...\n\u2022\nI hope your body serves you. Whether it's walking, stretching, or simply being in less pain than the day before, I hope you and your body are in a conversation. Lean into the challenge, the sweat, the pain. Listen. Your body is where the mind begins.\n\u2022\nI hope you have the simple pleasure of tasting something that nourishes your body or soul and brings you pleasure. A bright smoothie. A bowl of lentils. A perfectly cooked egg. A clean, clear glass of water. Campari. Cheese pizza. Whatever. I hope it tastes good and you can care that it does. And that it feeds your cells or lifts your spirit or both.\n\u2022\nAnd I hope you'll remember you don't have to be perfect to be beautiful. I don't know about you, but nothing and no one I've ever loved deeply was perfect. They were always pretty damn interesting though. Remember that in different seasons of life the same scene can fill you with joy or sadness. My hope for you today is that you'll see the light, be the light, laugh like at hell at my banalities and feel better and think \"those leaves look nice and glow.\" What is your mantra today? #livemoremagic \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nPs.

That she know the difference between healthy fear and bad fear. That she have a bright inner North Star. I want her to understand that in life some cliffs should not be jumped off of because there are rocks below. And that from other cliffs you can dive into the glittering, aqua sea, no matter how scary it may seem when you're looking down.\n\ud83d\udcab\nOn the latest episode of my show, the @rawmilkpodcast (follow along over there for daily motivation and inspiration in achieving your creative dreams!) that's what I'm talking about: How to Overcome Fear and Start. Whether it's a blog, an online business, a YouTube channel, an Instagram account, or a podcast...The first step is the leap. Everything afterwards becomes easier.\n\ud83c\udf08\nClick the link in profile to listen...and binge out on the other 15 episodes if you haven't listened before! It's a great way to pass the time during your holiday travels and hopefully it will give you the tools and motivation to tell your fear to take the backseat so you can bravely step out and pursue your dreams without letting a bunch of false beliefs in your way!\n\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\nLet me know in the comments what else you'd like to hear on the show!

Go follow @merefellows now...his new music project!\n\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\nHe just released his first single \"On the Run\"on @spotify and @itunes and pretty much everywhere else you could listen to music online.

Go give it a listen and give him some love & support!\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nCause he certainly gives Eula and I all the love & support he's got. Oh, and he's really freaking good.

Not only is a fresh, new episode of the @rawmilkpodcast out today...there's a brand new Thanksgivjng post up on Local Milk! And you can find it all through that little link in bio. The post includes some romantic, rustic table inspiration for people who prefer pink to orange, and the recipe for one of the most delicious things I've ever put in my mouth: these eggs.\n\ud83e\udd5a\nThink of these as deviled eggs but a heck of a lot easier, more \"ouef mayo\", but with Japanese inspired flavors. This recipe basically mashes together all of my culinary inspirations: the south, France, and Japan. And it's easy as heck and dope AF.\n\ud83c\udf73\nAnd don't limit these babies to your holiday table.
