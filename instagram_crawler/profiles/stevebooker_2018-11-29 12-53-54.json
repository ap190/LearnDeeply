It felt like I\u2019d just been hit with the riding bug and then unfortunately my knee stopped me. Not this time though! I\u2019ve just put up a new blog post all about it, the link is in my bio \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Also big shout outs go to @jordanaddison @girocycles @curvecycling @soigneurlondon @jamcycling"
