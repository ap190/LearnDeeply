Make first loop by chaining 25 and join for working in the round. I\u2019ve done two rows of half trebles (UK terms) to finish but you could use whatever stitch you like. When making the next and subsequent loops, make the 25 chains and make sure you join the chains around the previous loop before completing with two rows of half treble. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96",

For those of you who have asked, the crochet bauble is my own design (nothing fancy, just a sphere with a flower and bit of embroidery) and the knitted ones are all slightly different methods but I think I\u2019m leaning towards the @arnecarlos way of knitting the baubles and the middle part of the design is just whatever I feel like doing. \ud83d\ude42Hope you\u2019ve had a great Thursday!
