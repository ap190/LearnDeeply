At first she was resting as Charlie made his sorties to the surface for a little play time. Then Mrs Brown drifted up and spent what felt like an eternity on or just near the surface, with Charlie close by her side... and a little meeker when mum was watching. #whalesunderwater #whalesunderwater18 #wuwtonga18 #swimwithwhales #wuwhumpbacks18 #tonga\nCome with me, @pxlexplorer and the @whalesunderwater team and be amazed for yourself.

I\u2019ve been dreaming of experiencing this wonderful place and the incredible humpback whales that migrate here every year for a long time. I was fortunate to be able to join renowned Canon master @darrenjew and the incredibly talented @pxlexplorer along with their team from @whalesunderwater for what has already been a truly life changing experience. And to add to that I\u2019ve been able to share it all this time round with legends @davesandford & @thurstonphoto. I purposely came on this trip with little or no expectations as I wanted to experience it all with a clear mind and literally just be in the moment if and when it happened. Well, so many incredible moments have occurred in just the first few days and I have already made what I believe are some of my best nature images. Whales!! Giant, living, breathing, affectionate, caring, playful, curious, intelligent, excited, loving sea creatures which have absolutely captured my heart. Anyone who has been to Tonga and has been eye to eye with these humpbacks can attest to how special they are.\nNothing can prepare you for the breaching, fin and fluke slapping of a 40 tonne mammal just metres from the boat, or the immediate connection you feel when an excited calf leaves its mum to put on a show for you just below the surface! Believe you me, nothing comes close!\nI have so many subsurface images to share with you, but in the meantime here\u2019s one of my favourite above water moments so far! Just look at that fluke!!\nThank you Darren & Jasmine I look forward to seeing what the next few days have install for us all \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\n#whalesunderwater18 #wuwhumpbacks18",

The first time people hear them, in an encounter, people can barely believe it\u2019s the whales that are making the peculiar noises they hear. It\u2019s often referred to as the \u201cStar Wars\u201d sound, as it\u2019s sounds like it\u2019s being produced mechanically or synthetically.\nThe noises are so strange that before studies were done, it was thought Australian naval submarines might be making these strange sounds.\nBut really questions have to be asked why they make these crazy sounds? Is it the males or females, who are making these sounds? There is so much we don\u2019t know. It just makes this species of whale so special and fascinating.\n\nDwarf minke whales are the smallest of the three species of minke whale and have very different markings to the Antarctic and Common minkes. They reach a maximum length of 7m\u2019s and are found only in the Southern Hemisphere, where they spend summer in Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic waters and migrate North in the winter months. Although found off the coasts of South America and Africa, the largest known numbers forms an aggregation inside the protection of The Ribbon Reefs of The Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Here they seek out snorkelers and divers and are known to engage with humans for many hours at a time. Several individual whales have been known to return, year after year. One Whale has now spent 11 out of 12 seasons straight with us!",

On just one day this season we were blessed with sunlight and orcas for some brief moments of absolute magic.\nWe constantly face challenges here. Short days. Lack of light. Blizzards. Bitter cold.

Repost via @sea_legacy - Photo by @DaisyGilardini // My love for wildlife and the polar regions started long ago\u2026 I was only 4 years old when I received as a gift from my Godparents, a little stuffed seal puppy toy. My Mom explained that the seal puppy was coming from a very cold place and it lived on and under the Polar ice. I was mesmerized by those stories. Thereafter, I dreamed to be able to see them in their natural environment. It took me seven years to be able to save the money necessary to pay for a trip to Antarctica but that trip totally changed my life!\nI still remember the first I saw a seal. We landed on Half Moon Island in the South Shetlands. With a lump in my throat I was shaking from the emotion to be surrounded by hundreds of penguins and there, on the beach I saw my very first wedded seal. That day I could not even take a picture and the few I shot were all blurred because of the shaking.\nOver the years I have been back many times and this is one of my favourite seal shots.\n#turningthetide #weddellseal #climatechange @antarctica",

Watching this, we are almost as stunned as the poor little stingray.. we know Orcas are arguably the most dominant creature in the sea.. but who can explain this behaviour? Repost from @jchauser - The single most amazing underwater experience of my life. After almost seven years knocking on this door, crossing my fingers to spot wild orcas in Baja, I had one quick encounter in January, and now this. I feel overwhelmed and incredibly lucky for witnessing this one-in-a-million predatory behavior from the front row.",

We met up up with the Boy in the Pinstriped suit with his Mama and 2 Escorts this morning in the shallows near a reef #Amazing! Then we zoomed off to checkout this happy pair. A new set I believe, and young only about 2 months. The mother had the most whitest of white pectoral fins and her baby was so energetic with splashes, breaches and torpedo rises to the surface. The day was sunny and the water was clear and BRIGHT Blue with loads of rays! It was loads of fun being with the #aweosmefoursome and our such lovely guests. To share these experiences is really one of a kind and such a privilege. It makes me so so happy to be able do this. The whales and the Ocean\u2019s marine life are just superb experiences that one must include in their life.\u201d #somuchjoy \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc0b #whalesunderwater #wuwhumpbacks18 #whalesunderwater18 #darrenjew #pxlexplorer #mumandcalf #humpbackwhale #babycalf",
