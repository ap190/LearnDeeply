I\u2019ve got some news: 6 pieces from my Symbiotes collection are currently being showcased at Fotofever Paris, booth 312 (Arte Globale booth). Once again huge thanks to Arte Globale (@arteglobale) for making this happen. Fotofever Paris takes place in Carrousel du Louvre, Paris, between 8-11 November. If you\u2019re going to be in Paris this weekend, you should definitely check it out. If you miss out on this one, and you\u2019ll be in Miami, Florida, USA in December, some of my works will also be displayed at Scope Miami (December 4-9). I\u2019ll make a more detailed announcement for that one in the following weeks. Also, during my absence, my work was featured on CNN Style! There\u2019s a link to that article in my bio. In addition to the written piece there\u2019s also a voice memo which I didn\u2019t give a listen at all, simply because I always cringe to death whenever I hear my own voice on a recording. So, listen at your own risk. That\u2019s all for now. I\u2019ll be back, sooner than expected (hopefully). Peace!",

I\u2019ve got some news for you by the way: Recently I started working with @arteglobale (An art gallery in London). And my Symbiotes collection is now available as prints in limited editions (7+2) at Arte Globale. There\u2019s a link to my Arte Globale page in the bio. (You can find the same collection at artsy.net as well). I have also been featured in several publications lately. I\u2019ll be posting some stories regarding those features in the following days. So, stay tuned for some exciting news and updates. :) Happy Sunday!",

There had been numerous mishaps and I dealt with shipping crates, condition reports, temporary export documentations, etc for the first time in my life and trial and error method was the only method I could have used. So it was overwhelmingly frustrating from time to time, but, that\u2019s another story). Now, the good news is: A bunch of my works will be showcased at Zonamaco Foto 2018 (In their words: Mexico\u2019s photography art fair) between August 22-26. If you\u2019re going to be in Mexico City in that time frame, consider checking it out. My work will be displayed at booth C202 (Arte Globale booth) alongside works by Kevin Graham and Giovanni Cocco. I\u2019m really grateful to Arte Globale for making this happen and of course for their support (and patience) during this troublesome preparation process \ud83d\ude05 For more details see @arteglobale and @zonamacofoto.
