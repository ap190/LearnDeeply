They feared customers would abandon the downtown shopping district for new and convenient strip-malls and stores.\nPark and Shop\u2014developed by newspaper artist Campe B. Euwer\u2014drove home the merchants' message that shopping downtown could still be fast and fun. It's now in our @amhistorymuseum. #BlackFriday"

                        "comment": "When photography arrived in Japan in the mid-19th century, traditional woodblock printmakers were forced to adapt their craft to keep pace with the new medium. By the start of the 20th century, the traditional art of printmaking was on the verge of extinction.\nPublisher Watanabe Sh\u014dzabur\u014d saw the Western art market and the benefit of elevating prints in relation to painting, calligraphy and sculpture. He encouraged artists trained in painting to apply their aesthetic sensibilities to prints.\nWatanabe published this 1921 woodblock print, \"Morning in D\u014dtonbori, Osaka\" by Kawase Hasui. It's on view in our @freersackler's exhibition \"Japan Modern: Prints in the Age of Photography,\" which explores Japanese artists\u2019 reactions to the challenges of modernity from the late 19th to mid-20th century.\nIt\u2019s complemented by \u201cJapan Modern: Photography from the Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck Collection\u201d with works by groundbreaking 20th-century photographers."
