For just $125 plus shipping, you will receive signed 7.5 x 7.5 inch fine-art print of Yeye in the Mist AND an autographed copy of my book Panda Love: The Secret Life of Pandas. Hurry, this special is only available until Dec. 3 to insure a Dec. 24 delivery.\n\nAre you looking for a larger print of Yeye in the Mist? It\u2019s also available on my website until Dec. 31. Every Yeye print will come with your very owned signed copy of Panda Love. All photographs are printed by the fine art studio of Paper & Ink (@paperandinkstudio ) on archival paper which is designed to meet museum longevity requirements. Link is in the bio.\nPanda Love is a collection of images of these gentle giants on location in China. It captures the inspiring efforts to breed pandas and release them back into the wild. Fluffy panda cubs tumble out of baskets and play hide-and-seek with their carers, while the adult pandas curiously explore the forest and climb trees. China may be on its way to successfully saving its most famous ambassador, and \"Panda Love\" documents the process of putting the wild back into an icon.\n\n@natgeo @natgeoimagecollection @thephotosociety @nikonusa\n\n#sichuan #china #climatechange #conservation #savetheplanet #panda #pandas #babypanda #ipanda #giantpanda #pandacub #nikonusa #nikonlove #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador #photojournalism #amivitale #cuteanimals"

Come join me! (Link for tickets in profile.) Maa-speaking Samburu women wear elaborate beaded necklaces in Westgate Conservancy, Kenya. As one of Africa's most unique cultures, the Samburu are often recognized for their riveting beauty and decorative appearance. Samburu, which translates to mean \"butterflies,\" was given to the Samburu tribe by other tribes because of their layers and layers of bead-covered jewelry, face painting, and colorful clothing.\nThis week I\u2019m sharing images of women in Africa, exploring their lives and the vital roles they play in their communities.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeoimagecollection @nature_org @nrt_Kenya @nature_africa @magicalkenya #people #beautiful #kenya #magicalkenya #africa #everydayafrica #whyilovekenya #northernkenya #photojournalism #amivitale @nikonusa #nikon #nikonambassador #nikonnofilter #nature #africa #conservation"

The reversal allows for these products to be used in medical research or healing, uses long since proven to have no benefits to humans. This change will certainly lead to more pressure on already terribly vulnerable animal populations and further endanger the conservationists, rangers and communities who fight for the survival of these majestic creatures.\nHere, Sudan, the last living male Northern White Rhino left on this planet is comforted moments before he passed away March 19, 2018 in northern Kenya. Sudan was brought to Kenya from @safari_park_dvur_kralove in the #CzechRepublic in 2009. He died surrounded by people who loved him at @olpejeta and has been an inspirational figure for many across the world. If there is any meaning in his death, it's that Sudan can be our final wake up call. In a world of 7 billion, we need to start recognizing that we are not separate from nature. When we see ourselves as part of the landscape and part of nature, then saving nature is really about saving ourselves.\n\nToday, fewer 30,000 rhinos and 3,900 tigers remain in the wild. We are witnessing extinction on our watch and must help them by speaking out and supporting conservation efforts worldwide, especially among the indigenous communities who are on the front lines every day against poaching. Follow @olpejeta @safari_park_dvur_kralove @conservationorg @nature_africa and others to learn more and get involved.\n@everydayextinction\n@kenyawildlifeservice @thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeoimagecollection #LastManStanding #SudanForever #WorthMoreAlive #OlPejetaRhinos #NorthernWhiteRhinos #protectrhinos #DontLetThemDisappear #rhinos #saverhinos #stoppoaching #kenya#northernkenya #africa #everydayafrica #photojournalism #nikonusa #nikon #nikonambassador #nikonnofilter #amivitale"

Here, Shaba tries to playfully squish Nadasoit. Nadasoit arrived at Reteti when she was only 2-weeks-old. As she began to get stronger, she became one of the first orphans that proxy matriach Shaba took under her wing. Shaba was constantly with Nadasoit and Nadasoit was constantly with Shaba. Today, now that Nadasoit's a big strong 2-year-old elephant, she's adopted the nurturing traits of Shaba, and both constantly care for and help those younger than they are.\nIt has been an amazing privilege to witness Nadasoit's transformation, the transformation of Shaba and Nadasoit's relationship and the transformation of Reteti as it has gone from being a tiny refuge for orphaned and abandoned elephant calves to a world renowned facility that has helped rescue and nurture more than 34 elephant calves while driving the growth of all important community based conservation throughout northern Kenya in just two short years. Thank you for following along on this journey and supporting Reteti every step of the way.\n\n@conservationorg @natgeo @natgeocreative @thephotosociety @nikonusa @nature_africa @nrt_kenya @tusk_org @kenyawildlifeservice @sandiegozoo @magicalkenya @synology.official #elephant #saveelephants #retetielephants #stoppoaching #kenya #northernkenya #magicalkenya #whyilovekenya #africa #everydayafrica #nikonusa #nikonlove #nikonnofilter #nikonambassadors #photojournalism #amivitale"

I met Nolkidotu right after all of his family\u2019s wealth was lost in one night, when a pride of lions killed his cow in Naitiroki village in lower Loita, Kenya. It was a huge blow to the health of his family. Cases of human-wildlife conflict are common, and both sides suffer the consequences. Frequent meetings are held with farmers and pastoralists in the area, where wildlife movements can be shared and discussed, as can ways to mitigate risk, and what to do should an incident occur. These issues highlight the huge importance of communities and rangers working together to ensure the safety and livelihoods of both people and wildlife.\n\nI'm honored to take over WWF-UK's (@wwf_uk) account this week during the London Conference on Illegal Wildlife Trade. The Conference is an opportunity for global leaders to come together and make commitments to help end illegal wildlife trade. This year\u2019s conference will focus on three key themes; tackling the Illegal Wildlife Trade as a serious organised crime, building coalitions and closing markets.\n\nFollow @wwf_uk to learn more about their efforts to create solutions to the most serious conservation challenges facing our planet, helping people and nature to thrive.

Fatima is part of the Fulani tribe, who once crisscrossed the continent of Africa tending their precious herds of cattle, a civilization known for its constant movement. This nomadic existence spun the threads of a rich social fabric of tradition and ritual that endures to this day. The Fulani have traditions that are unique to its area and people. From the belief in tree spirits to the use of traditional medicine, the mixing of cultures that took place centuries earlier has produced a society that with a unique spiritual universe that is sometimes more important than the physical world.\n\nThis week I\u2019m sharing images of women in Africa, exploring their lives and the vital roles they play in their communities.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeo @nikonusa @natgeoimagecollection @alexiafoundation #africa #everydayafrica #guineabissau #photojournalism #nikonusa #nikonlove #nikonambassadors #amivitale"

I am deeply appreciative to all the groups and individuals who spoke out against this policy change and hopeful that the Chinese government will continue to act for conservation and in protection of these vulnerable species. The Chinese government and a group of committed individuals have brought back panda bears from the edge of extinction as well as reforested large parts of their terrain. Let us all work together to do the same for all species.\nToday, fewer 30,000 rhinos and 3,900 tigers remain in the wild. We are witnessing extinction on our watch and must continue to help them by speaking out and supporting conservation efforts worldwide, especially among the indigenous communities who are on the front lines every day against poaching.

So excited to be speaking at the @WorldPressPhoto 2018 Exhibition Opening in Washington, DC exhibition opening next Friday, Oct. 26 at the Dupont Underground. Organized by @lightscapedc, the opening runs from 6.30-10pm and will feature talks by three 2018 @WorldPressPhoto winners and show the 2018 winning work, a retrospective of Photo of the Year from 1955, the honorees of the @iwmf's Anja Niedringhaus Award, photos from four African Photojournalism Database photographers, and more. Do come out for this incredible affair.

This makes the community deeply invested in the effort\u2019s success. In earlier conservation efforts, threatened forests and endangered species were protected by uniformed guards. Here, they are protected by women and school children, who have a vested interest in a healthy environment because they benefit directly. Rather than something that has to be guarded from local communities, the environment becomes a source of sustainable economic activity for those communities.\n\nThis week I\u2019m sharing images of women in Africa, exploring their lives and the vital roles they play in their communities.\n\n@nature_africa @nature_org @thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeoimagecollection @nikonusa @magicalkenya #kenya #magicalkenya #northernkenya #whyilovekenya #conservation #womeninconservation #africa #everydayafrica #photojournalism #nikonusa #nikonlove #nikonambassador #amivitale"

In December 2009, I heard about a plan to airlift four of the last Northern White Rhinos from @safari_park_dvur_kralove in the Czech Republic back to Africa. It sounded like a storyline for a Disney film but in reality, it was a desperate, last ditch effort to save an entire species. The hope was to breed them. The air, water, and food, not to mention room to roam, might stimulate them to breed\u2014and the offspring would then be used to repopulate Africa.\nBack then, there were only eight of these gentle, hulking creatures alive, all in zoos. Today there are two, both in Kenya at Ol Pejeta Conservancy (@olpejeta). March 19th, Sudan, the last living male Northern White Rhino passed away. If there is any meaning in his death, its that Sudan can be our final wake up call. In a world of 7 billion, we need to start recognizing that we are not separate from nature. When we see ourselves as part of the landscape and part of nature, then saving nature is really about saving ourselves.\n\nIn honor of World Rhino Day on Sept. 22, I am sharing some of my favorite images of these magnificent, ancient creatures. Together we can work to save them - visit and support the communities that protect them.\n@nrt_kenya @tusk_org @kenyawildlifeservice @thephotosociety @natgeo @nature_org @nikonusa @nature_africa @synology.official #WorthMoreAlive #protectrhinos #DontLetThemDisappear #rhinos #SudanForever #OlPejetaRhinos #NorthernWhiteRhinos #saverhinos #stoppoaching #kenya #northernkenya #magicalkenya #africa #everydayafrica #worldrhinoday #photojournalism #nikonusa #nikonlove #nikonambassadors #amivitale"

Pete won the Prince William Award for Conservation in Africa, 2018 last week given by @tusk_org. I've known Pete for almost 10 years and the man is one of my greatest inspirations. He has committed his entire life to saving wildlife all over this planet and \u201cshown complete disregard for his personal safety, whilst spending many months at a time away from his family dedicating his entire energy and attention to the conservation and welfare of Africa\u2019s wildlife.\" The Telegraph writes, \u201cYou\u2019re always taking a few blows here and there,\u201d he laughs. He works in some of the world\u2019s least stable countries, in areas infested by armed poachers or rebel groups like the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army or uncleared mines. He once fractured his skull when his Cessna crashed. He reckons he has immobilised 10,000 animals. Inevitably a few have died. \u201cSuccess and failure are just a heartbeat away from each other,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be gutting. I\u2019ve had my share of failure and you just have to pick up and keep going and learn from what went wrong.\u201d #gratitude #tuskawards #tusktrust #conservation #africa"
