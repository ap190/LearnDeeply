I was heading to the famous Charles Bridge at 6am here in Prague when I saw a couple having their wedding photos taken. The bride must have been freezing in her dress! It was really dark so I turned my ISO up to 10,000. I grabbed a couple of quick shots and continued on to the bridge. That evening I was looking through my images and discovered that I had caught the wedding photographer\u2019s flash going off - which created a beautiful light for me. Of course if I tried to shoot when his flash was going off I would never get it - being lucky is good. Thanks to the other photographer for the unexpected assist!!\n-\n-\n-\n#prague #czechrepublic #wedding #flash #sonya7riii #bealpha"

Follow the link in my bio to purchase a copy. To make this project a reality took over two years and 5 trips. I\u2019m grateful to Bob Costas for writing the most poetic and meaningful foreword, and to Sigfredo Barros a great baseball writer from Cuba for his insights into the history and culture of the sport. Baseball in Cuba is almost as old as baseball in the United States. The oldest professional stadium is in Matanzas, Cuba \u2013 the first professional game was played there in 1874, and the stadium is still in use today. If you love travel, baseball Cuba or photography It is a terrific gift for the holidays.\n-\n-\n#baseball #cuba #beisbol #travel #photography #cubalovesbaseball @cubalovesbaseball"

This beautiful tree is on the grounds of a seminary. One of the large branches ripped a section out of its trunk when the weight of the snow broke it off the tree. I hope the tree survives the extensive damage.\n-\n-\n#tree #storm #chelsea"
