I\u2019m going away soon so I\u2019m using up bits and pieces in the fridge and with a block of tofu left to use I felt like making a bowl with a mix of japan inspired flavors: so here\u2019s: onigiri (had leftover sushi rice), carrot miso dip, roasted aubergine and sweet potato (I roasted a whole bunch of veggies earlier this week, which helped with making this meal ready within only 15,minutes) -\n-\n\nMy go-to cooking method for tofu is to fry the pieces with just a little bit of oil on medium heat, not turning until there\u2019s a dried up slightly crispy surface underneath. When all sides are crisp I splash on a prepared soy mixture sauce, only a few tablespoons and turn up the heat for a short spell, just to let the soy mixture dry up and be absorb into the tofu. and then it needs to be served straight away. -\n-\n\nThe soy mixture is often very simple and add-ins can vary, but usually I add a small amount of something sweet for a caramelised flavour, like coconut sugar or agave syrup. I vary between adding black pepper, sesame oil, tahini or homemade hoisin sauce, chili, garlic and ginger. -\n-\n\nIn case you want to make parts of this bowl at home, there\u2019s recipes for the onigiri (rice ball) tsukemono (Japanese style pickles), furikake, roasted veg and Aubergine in my book Feasts of Veg, the carrot miso dip is from Bowls of Goodness. -\n-\n-\n#ricebowl #onigiri #wholefoodsplantbased #eattherainbow\ud83c\udf08 #buzzfeast #f52grams #mindfuleating #mealprep #aubergine #tofu #tsukemono #bowlsofgoodness #feastsofveg #sushi #plantpowered #veganbowls #huffposttaste #buzzfeedtasty #todayfood #buzzfeast #healthyish #thechalkboardeats #f52grams #onmytable #nourishyourbody"

Like the handmade ceramics and textiles in the shop, im not a big time shopper but this is the kind of business I love to support, small and passionate about craft and quality, and now I didn\u2019t even mention the creative menu in the cafe yet, it\u2019s another post for another visit. Thanks for a lovely afternoon Michelle with family! -\n-\n-\n#iamatraveler #canggu #mytinyatlas #suitcasetravels #takemethere #bali #islandlife #theartofslowliving #livemoremagic #darlinescapes #welltravelled #guardiantravelsnaps #travelstoke #cofffe #ceramics"
