Growing up in a Filipino household, fast food was a luxury and a special treat. Culturally, we never really ate burgers and fries, let alone In-N-Out. The first time I had an In-N-Out burger was in Middle School when a friend's mom took us through the drive thu during a carpool home. I was embarrassed that I never had In-N-Out because my friends talked about it all the time. So I pretended like I had it before. I can still remember my first bite... and having to control losing it in front of my friend before he found out I\u2019ve never really had it before. It just tasted so damn good. And it still tastes so damn good every time. It may not be the most sophisticated food, but it\u2019s still one of the best things I ever ate. And I\u2019m sticking to it. Stay hungry. Stay foolish.\n\u2764\ufe0f,\nJed @dailyfoodfeed",
