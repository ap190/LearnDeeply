Alex talks about his recent move to Durham, and shift in careers. He also discusses how being a part of the running community has been a great way to become familiar with a new city, participating in group runs like the Ponysaurus Pub Run and the Vecino Pub Run.\n-\nIn Raleigh, Andy Chang (Fleet Feet Raleigh/Morrisville ) discusses the largest trail system in the Research Triangle- Umstead State Park.  Chang tells us about what Umstead and the Research Triangle have to offer for wooded, single-track trails.\n-\nIn Chapel Hill / Carrboro, Sean Bezdek (Fleet Feet Carrboro) runs the trails of Carolina North Forest. Sean discusses how he got into running, leaving behind a difficult family situation and the unhealthy lifestyle he was living as a sponsored skateboarder.\n-\nWatch the full show at toptrail.runnerspace.com!\n-\n#toptrails #running #hokaoneone #runnerspace #tulsa",
