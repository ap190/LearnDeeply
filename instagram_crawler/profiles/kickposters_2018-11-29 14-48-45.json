There\u2019s a 350 v3 rumoured, as well as a crazy looking 451 silhouette. But for me the most interesting one is the upcoming Basketball shoe. We\u2019ve seen Kanye rock \u2018em a few times and they are really growing on me. I like how he\u2019s managed to implement recognisable Yeezy styling, with the 700 toe pieces and the Zebra style print along the sides. Let me know your thoughts, are they a cop or a drop for you.

These are the @absolutevintagelondon Yung-1, and there\u2019s only 100 pairs. Made to pay homage to the old Absolute Vintage store, as well as to play on the idea of walking into a vintage store and finding a steal, the two brands dropped these without any announcement at all. But the biggest nod to the vintage come-up theme, they retailed at only \u00a328!!\n\u2014\nThere\u2019s also a black pair, and I believe remaining pairs will drop Nov 24th at the adidas Hanbury Street Store in Shoreditch, which in fact used to be the old Absolute Vintage store.\n\u2014\nThanks to the @adidaslondon team for sending these my way! Much appreciated. \u270c\ud83c\udffb"
