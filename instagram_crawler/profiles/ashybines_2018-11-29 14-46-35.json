Everythign boils down to choice,yes youll get thrown some shitty times and hard challenges but we get to choose what we do with them,how we move on,the meaning we put on them,who we blame,what step is next and how we respond! .\nWe excist in a world of possibilities,every choice we make , shuts down some doors and opens up new ones.\n.\nAt any point we can change the direction of our lives from who we are around to what we decide to do next. .\nIts all in our hands, our hearts and our minds.\n.\nPLEASE REMEMBER \u2013 Most of your stress comes from the way you respond , not the way life is. Adjust your attitude and itll take away all the extra added stress you and your mind/body don\u2019t need.\n.\nYOU ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE. What do you choose NEXT?"

Or have you forgotten to be in the moment and appreciate it or give yourself a hi 5? .\nIf you are constantly in forward motion, how often do you stop to look at where you are, what you have and how you live? Having future goals is a MUST don\u2019t get me wrong BUT sometimes stopping and being in the moment of NOW and feeling proud is important.\n.\nAt some point you would have wished for what you have now.\nToday is the perfect day to celebrate that.\nDon\u2019t let tomorrows goals rob you of what could be celebrated today. Every day try to find SOMETHING to celebrate. Because life\u2019s too short not to. \u2764\n.\nALSO - I showed this bag on my Snapchat and had a discount code for 24 hours BUT since I first showed it my DMS every day are filled with \u201c what was that bag you showed again\u201d lol make sure you babes click follow or swipe up when I show things so you don\u2019t forget - this bad boy is from @prenebags and they have kindly activated the same code \u201c PRENEASHY\u201d but be quick as same as last time won\u2019t last!

ANYONE FEEL ME?\n.\nBUT - I am REAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLYYY feel proud of how I deal with it all these days,I feel ive grown so much and don\u2019t let myself get my knickers in a twist haha wow that\u2019s something mum use to say to me,in other words don\u2019t allow myself to get super worked up to the point of on the floor anxiety attacks and days of meltdowns and not being able to get out of bed \u2013 YEP that use to be me and me trying to deal with LIFE.\n.\nIve learned to breathe,yep sounds simple but wow really makes a difference ,Ive also learned that tough times don\u2019t last tough people do,ive learned to accept that life isn\u2019t meant to be easy and no one has it easy and when you accept that, take care of what you can control and let go of what you CANT control you just use your energy where its going to actually help you instead of wasting it on stressed energy.\n.\nIve also learned to allow myself to have cry- yes that happened for a moment today now its passed \ud83d\ude09 ,ask for help and lean on those around me when I need some extra support myself.\n.\nIf you are having one of those days I hope you reading this can give you some guidance and tools to help you get through a rough day/week. We can only do so much and we are in control of how we handel each situation. Just do the best you can. \u2764 .\nBring on bora bora next month ahhhhh island dreaming \ud83c\udf34\u2600\ufe0foh and special thanks to those around me who have been my back bone this week you know who you are \ud83d\ude18 Don\u2019t forget to check in on those around you never know when you will make their day brighter \ud83c\udf1f\n.\nLASHES @sheridanjane_lashesandbrows"

We all have elements of ourselves that we don\u2019t love, and no one has any right whatsoever to tell someone how they should feel about their own body. We forget we all have insecurities and all battle through things that some of you won\u2019t ever know about and forget you only see such small snippets of peoples lives and most of the time the highlights. .\nIf someone is upset, we have no right to tell them that they shouldn\u2019t be.\nIf someone is hurt, we have no place to tell them they are over reacting.\nIf someone is sharing a truth for them, we have zero right to slam them for that because it is after all, their truth. .\nIt may not be your truth, you may not understand it, you may not \u201c agree \u201c but it\u2019s not your place to judge someone else on how they feel. .\nLets all try to be a little bit more tolerant and compassionate towards others in real life and those we come across on Social Media.\nIf you don\u2019t agree with something, unfollow or just keep scrolling. It really can be that simple or just think twice before commenting and always try to think how you\u2019d feel if someone said it to you, or your best friend or your mum or daughter or sister? How would that make you feel? .\nPS last 5 hours of our @tonedbyashybines Black Friday sale with up to 70% off active wear \ud83d\ude0d www.tonedbyashybines.com"

It doesn\u2019t matter if they like you, what matters is that you like who you are\ud83d\udc95 We spend way to many hours hoping to be accepted, when what we really need is to accept ourselves.\n.\n* A thigh gap \ud83d\ude44Honestly this is one of the most ridiculous \u2018trends\u2019 to ever come about - I\u2019ve even had girls ask why I don\u2019t have one because I should when I\u2019m a \u201c fitspo \u201c . For some it\u2019s a natural thing based on the width of their hips, for others it\u2019s physically impossible based on the exact same reason \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n.\n* How \u2018it\u2019 would turn out - Even if it doesn\u2019t make sense at the time, I know that given the opportunity we can always find purpose in everything and it works out the exact way it\u2019s meant to. .\n* What people say about me - Peoples opinions of us say nothing about us, and everything about them and a lot of the time a reflection of what they are feeling about themselves and just how they choose to spend their time\ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n.\n* Body Changes - We are always evolving, facing challenges, creating a life and moving through time. We are not meant to look the same as we did five years ago. You aren\u2019t meant to have a pre-baby body after you\u2019ve had a baby. You aren\u2019t meant to look like you\u2019re 18 when you\u2019re 30. Our bodies change and grow as we go through life, our job is to celebrate , appreciate and care for them while we are lucky enough to have them.\n.\nTurning 30 on Sunday - and I\u2019m really proud of where I am - I feel 30, I feel great, happy, proud, content and healthy \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\n.\nTAG someone who you think this will resonate \ud83d\udc95"
