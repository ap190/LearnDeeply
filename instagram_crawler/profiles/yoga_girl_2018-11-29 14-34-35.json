When I say I\u2019m going on maternity leave I mean with the one baby I already have - I never took any time of when Lea Luna was born. I taught 8 weeks of retreats and trainings the year I had her; the first one she was only 4 weeks old (what was I thinking!!?)\ud83d\ude48 I never stopped working. I hired more people and learned how to delegate but I never stopped. So... Right now, I\u2019m trying to find a way to slow down and live at a different pace. I\u2019ll still be leading retreats and trainings, of course. Next year I have almost 20 weeks of programs. That\u2019s close to half the year, immersed 24/7 in trainings and retreats and groups. It\u2019s an amazing gig! I love, love, love teaching. I just don\u2019t think I should be working a second full time job at the same time. If you\u2019re leading a 23-day training you should probably use your early mornings and late evenings to rest, not to continue working. So. I\u2019m thinking next year I\u2019ll create a Rachel-appropriate version of maternity leave that works for me. Trainings and retreats remain. The podcast, too (I\u2019d never leave that ever!). Recording this weeks episode in a bit to see if I can wrap my head around what this next phase in my life will bring. \u2063\n\u2063\nI love you all. Thank you for being here and for holding this space. x\u2063\n\u2063\nPhoto by @wildernessstories"

This little app has been that for me for so many years; reminders of things I need to hear. This is why I talk about self-love, or forgiveness, or healing, or letting go. Not because I have it all together but because inside of myself, I tend to fall apart. My whole life is made up by a string of broken things I have tried to make whole. People, mostly. I almost always fail because other people are not ours to fix. Not our parents or our siblings or our spouses or our friends. Not even our children - but we can do everything in our might to keep them whole and safe along the way. Truth is, we can\u2019t fix anyone else. We can only fix ourselves. And when I need that reminder, that the world is not mine to save and that all is well and to trust and to breathe, I write it down and post it here. It\u2019s not just for you, the things I share. It\u2019s also for me. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nInstagram became a way for me to speak everything out loud; my fears, my hopes, my dreams. My struggles. I know that much of what I feel, other people feel too. But lately, I\u2019ve been struggling. A lot. I don\u2019t know how to communicate it so I don\u2019t. Sometimes it\u2019s easy, sharing what\u2019s truly real. Right now it isn\u2019t. Maybe I\u2019m tired of sharing. I know I\u2019m tired of judgement. Tired of fixing so many broken things. Or maybe I\u2019m just tired and this is the first vacation I have taken in 6 years and not doing anything is making me weirdly agitated. I\u2019m not sure. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nI have a feeling I\u2019m exiting. From what, I don\u2019t know. Toward what, I have no clue. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nI know I wish I could stay here, on this dock, by this ocean. Then I remember... It\u2019s the same ocean I have at home. I just never sit by it anymore. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nLife takes you where you\u2019re supposed to go. And I\u2019m going home. x\u2063\n\u2063\n#vacation #home #bonaire #bellafontepenthouse405"

The beach is made up by pieces of white coral, broken off the reef by nature and time and then washed up on shore. I lie down and let the sunshine warm my bones. I don\u2019t care about sunscreen. I care about her. She goes up and down our little sliver of coral beach more times than I can count, picking up pieces of rock and throwing them into the sea. It\u2019s like she\u2019s giving the ocean back pieces of herself, determined, one at a time. For a while she just stands with her feet in the water, looking out at the shades of blue. \u201cWhere did Pappa go?\u201d she asks, surprising me as always with her newfound ability to string words together. How did she get so big? Time stands still and moves much too quickly all at once. I take her hand in mine and point at the ocean. \u201cPappa is diving\u201d I say. \u201cOver there. See? He\u2019ll be back soon\u201d. She looks at me and then back at the ocean. \u201cPappa diving.\u201d Diving is a new word. She pronounces it tentatively, tasting it in her mouth for the first time. \u201cPappa diving. Back soon.\u201d She looks out at the horizon, accepting what I\u2019ve told her fully. In her life, everyone always comes back soon. No one is missing for too long. We are complete also when we are apart. \u2063\n\u2063\nI think about all the people I\u2019ve lost and how I\u2019ll never look at a Back Soon with that kind of trust. Even now, in this perfect moment, I wonder how long Dennis will be. If the dive is going well. If an hour has passed. But I guess that\u2019s what life is. We lose so we can find. And in the end... I found her. Or maybe she found me.\u2063\n\u2063\nShe bends over to pick up another piece of coral. I sit there and I love her. \u2063\n\u2063\nFor as long as I live, it\u2019s where I\u2019ll be."
