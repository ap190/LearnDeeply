But if you haven\u2019t given yet, there is still time. Your support is critical. Without our network of supporters, our Rangers would only be able to do a fraction of the work they do. Did you know rangers create pockets of peace in conflict-ridden zones, are providing security to 2.1 million people living in and around the parks we manage, and are the guardians for wildlife who cannot protect themselves? If you donate today, your gift to African Parks will go twice as far \u2013 because every dollar is being matched up to $25,000. And every dollar will go directly to the parks - where it\u2019s needed most.

Many of you have asked how you can help save the species you see on my IG and on NG IG.\nUPDATE: This Giving Tuesday, our goal is to raise $25,000. The outpouring of support has been incredible \u2013 thank you to everyone who has contributed so far. Each dollar donated today will be matched by a generous donor up to $25,000 - which means we could raise a total of $50,000. That\u2019s enough to provide professional training to 25 new Rangers, developing the critical skills they need to do their jobs effectively!\nWe asked Aimee, one of our Rangers who lives and works in Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo why she does what she does. \u201cSo that my son and other children will always be able to see the animals in this park.\u201d That\u2019s a future we can all believe in. We hope you will take advantage of this Giving Tuesday opportunity and see your donation go twice as far. Every dollar counts.

Mike is part of the team that makes it all work! Community is vitally important - here - rangers come in from being out in the field for 12 days - while others are getting ready to leave. These men and women are brothers and sisters - cousins - neighbors. They all have a important link to protecting the park it\u2019s wildlife and the people - their family and neighbors that live within.\nRangers are often the first, and last line of defense not just in protecting the world\u2019s wildlife, but in providing safety for millions of people around the world. Here in Zakouma National Park in Chad, after a devastating eight years where poaching reduced the elephant population from 4,000 to 400, the rangers are doing more than just holding the line. In 2010 in partnership with the Chadian Government, conservation organization African Parks @africanparksnetwork assumed management of the park and overhauled law enforcement. It wasn\u2019t for the faint of heart. Just a year after cracking down on poaching, six rangers were killed by poachers during their morning prayers before going out on patrol. But the rangers persevered and continued in their fight to protect the Park, its wildlife, and the surrounding communities. Eight years later, poaching has essentially become non-existent. Employment is on the rise, thousands of children are going to schools built by the park, and tourism is booming.\nRhinos were even reintroduced after a 50-year absence just in May, and elephants are on the rise for the first time in a decade. A record number of elephant calves were recently counted - showing new life and hope has been restored to Zakouma, thanks to the rangers.

Many of you have asked how you can help save the species you see on my IG and on NG IG.\nToday you can do something important to help secure a future for Africa's wildlife and wild places - support the life-saving work of our Rangers. These men and women stood up against militarized poachers. They put their lives on the line to bring peace to their communities. They work to ensure their neighbors have the opportunities they deserve. Rangers don\u2019t just protect wildlife - they bring jobs, education, and stability. Our goal today is to raise $25,000. This is enough to equip 100 Rangers with two pairs of boots, a headlamp, a water filter, and a personal first aid kit - critical supplies every Ranger needs when out on patrol. And every dollar donated today before midnight will be matched by a generous donor. This means that we could raise enough to supply these kits to 200 Rangers! Can we count on you?
