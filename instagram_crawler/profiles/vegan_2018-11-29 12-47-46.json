It targets the nervous system and kidneys and is particularly harmful to developing fetuses and children, who can suffer brain damage and cognitive disabilities from exposure to #mercury.\n.\nAll fish have some mercury. When little fish are eaten by bigger fish (like tuna), the amount of mercury biomagnifies. But that\u2019s not all, fish are also high on cholesterol and often contaminated with PCBs and even plastic! According to one article, \u201cSeafood eaters ingest up to 11,000 tiny pieces of plastic every year with dozens of particles becoming embedded in tissues, scientists have warned.\u201d Yikes.\n.\nThe best way to reduce your exposure to mercury and other toxins found in fish is by simply not eating them.

To win a complete set of #NutraKik mixes for you AND a friend, just make sure you're following @KawiFoods and tag a friend in the comments below who inspires you to eat healthier, and let them know how much you appreciate them. Winner will be picked on Friday 11/30!\n.\nI discovered #KawiFoods last year and fell in love with their wholesome ingredients and eco-conscious mission. When you buy liquid soup broth, it comes in large containers that are often lined with plastic and not recyclable. Because these are dried powders, they are able to fit in small packages which dramatically reduces waste and improved shelf life.\n.\nA single package of this contains 28 servings of soup! They're far more sustainable, plus they're all #organic and of course delicious!\n.\nIf you want to get your paws on some now, you can get 15% off with the code \"VEGAN\" at KawiFoods.com (link in @KawiFoods bio). It's a perfect pantry staple for the fall and winter seasons. Noodle soup cheers to all!! -Michelle \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udf3e",
