At first the\ncourting birds were a bit shy, and moved down below, but after the hornbill sat there for a few minutes, they realized he wasn\u2019t a threat and moved back up to their favorite branches for display. In all my years photographing birds-of-paradise, this is one of the\nfunniest things I\u2019ve seen.

I\u2019ve just been up in Gunung Palung National Park in Borneo, checking on my ongoing @NatGeo camera trapping project, and this is one of the intriguing shots I found on my cameras. Instead of walking through the frame like I was planning, this Clouded Leopard just came in the edge, sat down, and took a rest. He triggered the camera multiple times, but he left again without fully entering the frame\u2026.. so goes camera trapping. Time to re-frame, re-set, and keep trying. But it is kind of cool anyway, and very exciting to get a glimpse of this spectacular animal, one of five cat species in this incredibly rich rain forest, one of the best remaining lowland forests in all of Borneo. #cloudedleopard, #GunungPalungNationalPark, #Kalimantan, #rainforest, #Borneo, #IndonesiaBiodiversity.",

This region supports one of the only remaining large tropical forests in the world and is home to nearly half of Indonesia\u2019s biodiversity. Over 600 species of birds are found in Papua, including 27 bird-of-paradise species, many of which live nowhere else on earth. Global interest in Papua\u2019s birdlife is leading to increased opportunity for wildlife tourism and bringing newfound economic benefits to local communities. Sustainable development is not only important for the future of Papua\u2019s forests and people, but also for the world.\nThe Cornell Lab\u2019s Birds-of-Paradise Project is working with the Governments of Papua and West Papua and other international partners to further science, engagement and conservation of the region\u2019s biodiversity with a focus on the birds-of-paradise.\n#RajaAmpat, #Waigeo, #Papua, #Indonesia, #TanahPapua, #PapuaBiodiversity, #RedBirdofParadise, #BirdofParadise.",

Now there is a chance for you to make a difference for these amazing birds, and all the biodiversity of Papua, where species like this incredible Red Bird-of-Paradise live. As I have mentioned in some recent posts, the government of West Papua, Indonesia, has declared their intent to be a \u201cConservation Province\u201d or \u201cProvinsi Konservasi\u201d in Indonesian, and protect 70% of their land as forest, as well as protect vast marine areas. In December, there will an important vote in the Provincial government taking place to make this Conservation Province declaration into law, which is a very important first step in actually putting this noble goal into practice. People all over the world can support this cause by simply signing a petition to let the government of Papua know that we are aware of the amazing conservation leadership they are taking and wish to support and encourage them. Please go to the link in my IG profile, or this link https://www.sealegacy.org/pages/west-papua?utm_source=tlaman&utm_campaign=westpapua&utm_content=petition and sign the petition organized by our good friends at @SeaLegacy, to help reach the goal of 30,000 signatures. It will only take a minute. Thanks for your support. #ProvinsiKonservasi #WestPapua #ConservationProvince #TanahPapuaa",

This region supports one of the only remaining large tropical forests in the world and is home to nearly half of Indonesia\u2019s biodiversity. Over 600 species of birds are found in Papua, including 27 bird-of-paradise species, many of which live nowhere else on earth. At a major international Conference in Manokwari on Oct 10, the provinces made a major commitment to a green future. West Papua has declared itself a \u201cConservation Province\u201d and both provinces have tremendous environmental leadership, and committed to preserving 70% of their land as forest. Amazing and it was very inspiring to be present here the passion of the governors to protect their lands.

Two of the incredible six species of Birds-of-Paradise that are found ONLY in the province of West Papua. Right now, you have a chance to make a difference for these amazing birds, and all the biodiversity of Papua. As I have mentioned in some recent posts, the government of West Papua, Indonesia, has declared their intent to be a \u201cConservation Province\u201d or \u201cProvinsi Konservasi\u201d in Indonesian, and protect 70% of their land as forest, as well as protect vast marine areas. In December, there will an important vote in the Provincial parliament to make this Conservation Province declaration into law, which is a very important first step in actually putting this noble goal into practice. People all over the world can support this cause by simply signing a petition to let the government of Papua know that we are aware of the amazing conservation leadership they are taking and wish to support and encourage them. Please go to the link in my IG profile, or this link https://www.sealegacy.org/pages/west-papua?utm_source=tlaman&utm_campaign=westpapua&utm_content=petition and sign the petition organized by our good friends at @SeaLegacy, to help reach the goal of 30,000 signatures. It will only take a minute. Thanks for your support. #ProvinsiKonservasi #WestPapua #ConservationProvince #TanahPapua",

This is one of the Raja Ampat Islands, home of the Red and Wilson\u2019s Birds-of-Paradise, and part of the \u201cConservation Province\u201d declared by the Province of West Papua, Indonesia. This province, along with its neighbor to the East, Papua Province, have made a major commitment to a green future on Oct 10 at a major international conference in Manokwari by committing to preserving 70% of their land as forest. This is hugely significant for our planet, and hats off to the bold leaders who have the courage to take this action. #ConservationProvince, #ProvinsiKonservasi #RajaAmpat, #Waigeo, #Papua, #Indonesia, #TanahPapua, #PapuaBiodiversity, @TimLaman.
