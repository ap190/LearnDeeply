Yum! I also added some raspberries after I took this photo\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb I have used natural sheeps milk yoghurt but for dairy free use coconut yoghurt. Here's the recipe... x\n\u2022\nINGREDIENTS\n\u2022\n1 1/4 cups flour (I\u2019ve used 1 cup of buckwheat flour + 1/4 cup spelt flour)\n2 cups almond milk\n1 egg\n1/4 tsp vanilla\nA pinch of sea salt\n\u2022\nMETHOD\n\u2022\nWhisk the ingredients together in a mixing bowl until super smooth, allow the mixture to rest for 10-15 minutes.\nAdd a tiny bit of coconut oil or butter to a non stick pan on medium to high heat.\nRoughly add 3/4 cup of the crepe batter and swirl around your pan so it thinly coats the pan. If it feels a little thick whisk a little more milk into the mixture. Also, I find the first crepe or pancake is always a dud (why is that?!) so don\u2019t worry, the rest will be great!\nOnce little bubbles begin to surface on the crepe flip it over and cook for roughly 30 seconds.\nRemove from pan onto a plate and set aside.\nCook the rest of the mixture and serve warm with yoghurt, pure maple and your favourite fruit.\n\u2022\nEnjoy!

Here's the recipe for the falafel and wrap/salad... enjoy! x\n\u2022\nGreen Pea & Herby Falafel\n\u2022\nINGREDIENTS\n\u2022\n1 \u00bd cups dried chickpeas - soaked in filtered water overnight, then drained\n\u00bd red onion\n1 cup fresh coriander\n1 \u00bd cups fresh parsley\n2 tbs extra virgin olive oil\n2 tbs apple cider vinegar or lemon juice\n1 cup frozen peas\n2 \u00bd tsp ground cumin\n2 tsp whole coriander seeds\n1 tsp baking powder\n1 tsp smokey paprika\n4 cloves garlic, peeled\n1 tsp flaked sea salt\n\u2022\nMETHOD\n\u2022\nPulse together the falafel ingredients in a food processor until the mixture is combined and mixed together, but still has texture. You want the mixture to be a little chunky but not a smooth paste.\nRoll the mixture into balls about 1 \u00bd tbs in size and place onto two paper-lined baking trays.\nDrizzle the falafel balls with olive oil and bake at 250C / 480F for 20 minutes.\nRemove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.\n\u2022\nI\u2019ve served my falafels in flatbreads with beetroot hummus, sliced avocado, rainbow beets, fresh mint and coriander leaves, grilled halloumi, and quick pickled red onion (I soak red onion slices in apple cider vinegar for 30 minutes).\n\u2022\nThese ingredients are also delicious served in a salad instead of a flatbread...\nPlace some shredded lettuce and kale in a serving bowl, top with dollops of hummus, sliced avocado, fresh mint leaves, fresh coriander leaves, grilled halloumi, falafel, and quick pickled onion.\nDrizzle with olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice and serve. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\u263a\ufe0f\n\u2022\nEnjoy the recipe and feel free to ask any questions!

My family are obsessed with it (after receiving all my test versions) I hope you will love it too! I just finished making this new batch over the weekend \ud83e\udd17 Here's the final recipe... x\n\u2022\nINGREDIENTS\n\u2022\n2 cups roasted almonds\n2 cups coconut, shredded, flaked or desiccated\n2 cups rolled oats\n120g dates - roughly 6-7 fresh Medjool dates, pitted - OR - packet pitted dates, soaked in boiling water for 10 minutes then drained\n\u2153 cup coconut oil, solid\n\u00bc cup pure maple syrup\n1 tbs vanilla extract, paste or powder\nA pinch of sea salt\n\u2022\n\u2153 cup raspberry jam - I like to use the brand \u2018St. Dalfour\u2019 as it has no added sugar, but any raspberry jam will work just fine\n\u2022\n\u00be cup cacao powder\n\u00be cup coconut oil\n\u00bc cup pure maple syrup\nTiny pinch sea salt\n\u2022\n1 cup coconut flakes (for sprinkling)\n\u2022\nMETHOD\n\u2022\nAdd the almonds, coconut, oats, dates, coconut oil, maple, vanilla and sea salt to a food processor.\nBlend until combined and the mixture begins to stick together.\nLine a 26x13cm brownie pan with non-stick paper.\nAdd \u2154 of the oat mixture to the prepared tin, pressing down firmly with your hands.\nSpread over the raspberry jam.\nSprinkle the remaining oat mixture over the jam layer so it is completely covered.\nGently press it down firmly.\nAdd the cacao powder, coconut oil, maple and sea salt to a small saucepan.\nMelt over low to medium heat, continually stirring as it melts.\nOnce smooth remove from the heat. Try not to overheat the mixture - it will be quite thick so stirring continuously is a must. It should only take about a minute or two to come together.\nPour the chocolate mixture over the oat and jam layers, sprinkle with the coconut and place in the freezer to set for a few hours.\nRemove from the freezer, cut into bite size pieces and enjoy!\nStore the slice in an airtight container in the fridge. It will keep for 1-2 weeks. It also keeps well in the freezer for 4-6 weeks.\n\u2022\nEnjoy! Ash\u270c\ud83c\udffb x  #gatherandfeast",
