Lots of my pictures was in Bandung that time with foggy hills, foggy woods, everything about fog. I used snapseed and did something with the ambience so it looks more moody. And always, a vscocam and put M3 or G1. Yes that moment there wasn\u2019t a lot of options. Anyway, hope you enjoy this bergen mood that reminds me of Bandung somehow. I know it\u2019s very different but well that\u2019s what i feel. #myvikingstory @vikingcruises",

I always remember how he takes splendid picture with reflection and drops of the rains. Wishing someday i could do the same in Paris.\n.\nThen i followed Joanna a year after. Her perspective taught me how to take amazing portrait of the strangers. A genre of photos that i always love but somehow i think i\u2019ll be never good enough. But Joanna and her photos made me dream about Paris, walking by myself, with music on my head, taking pictures of strangers that i will never meet again.\n.\n\nSomehow, it never crossed my mind that i will take pictures with them in the street of Paris.

When i\u2019m inside the airplane usually i think a lot about how amazing it is being inside a tin can above the clouds, flying. Something that human can\u2019t do. I always try to enjoy every moment looking out at the window (yes i\u2019m a window seat person) especially when i have the night flight because i can see the stars and feel so close with them.\nBut sometimes i think about falling. \u201dIf the airplane fell what should i do?\u201d So i always think about giving up when i\u2019m in the airplane. I give up my bad thoughts and trying to enjoy the time when i can be so close with the clouds while watching some movies or listening some music. But in my heart, i always train myself to be ready when the time comes. Yes, i\u2019m the kind of pessimistic people. So i always expect the worst and try to find the solution. .\nBut i know i\u2019ll never be ready. And i know i\u2019ll never know.\nWell, and this is just another long caption with personal thought that unrelated with the photo that i post.

He didn\u2019t really want to at the first moment but i promised to him it will be only Trocadero. In the end we walked until the banks of Seine which was the place i wanted to be. I know it smells peepee sometimes but lots of part don\u2019t have the smell.

The fact is, Belem tower, according to the wikipedia, is a fortified tower that build from the 15th century. Today, this tower is in the UNESCO heritage site because of the significant role it played in the Portuguese maritime discoveries of the era of the Age of discoveries. And honestly, in my humble opinion, this tower is so enchanting when you see it by yourself.
