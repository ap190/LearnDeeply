The article follows astronauts from the European Space Agency as they participate on a training course as part of ESA Pangaea-X. On the course, the astronauts learnt how to prepare geological and geobiological sampling along with testing equipment on the Moon and Mars. And for this, the course took place on Lanzarote, a perfect location to simulate the landscape.

The deepest point in the deepest cave in the world. In the background, Andrey Shuvalov looks to see whether there is a passage underwater heading off into the unknown.\nA week later, during the flood pulse that suddenly plummeted into these chambers, all of this gallery completely filled up with water and was totally submerged.\nFor a more detailed caption about the expedition, checkout the first comment below. Otherwise, please follow the link in my bio and read the full harrowing story written by @AndrewBisharat at @NatGeo. Stay tuned as we share more photographs from this epic expedition in Veryovkina - the deepest cave in the world. #deepcave #PerovoSpeleoCavingTeam #deepestcaveintheworld #exploration #explore #explorers #adventure #science #natgeosociety #flood #flooding @petzl_official @3leggedthing #Scurion",
