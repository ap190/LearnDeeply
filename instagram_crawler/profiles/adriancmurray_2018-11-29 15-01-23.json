Though I also have to pay the bills so I also make ads for brands. Which is fun! This project I\u2019ve been working on has been going on since May and I\u2019m getting closer to revealing what it is. Though it\u2019s just not ready yet. I do want to touch on the topic of ads though.... you follow me for photography... why complain if I use my talents to make ads? I have seen some complaints about that and my project actually addresses that in many regards. Though I am curious as to why that\u2019s a bad thing. If you have followed an artist who discovered that selling presets isn\u2019t a sustainable income when everyone and their mother does it, and videos are free on you tube, then why does it matter who they make the images for? At least with this I can feed my family and try to pay off the half a million dollars in student loans.... (not hyperbole)",
