Any entrepreneur will tell you that the highs are high and the lows are low. I\u2019m blaming all the pie I ate for breakfast afterwards, Rascals trip to the vet, my birthday that felt like a mid life crisis and the tequila \ud83e\udd43that I consumed from my birthday \ud83c\udf82\n.\nChatting a bit about anxiety as a blogger and getting \u2018older\u2019 on the blog today. I\u2019m also sharing the cutest Mrs. Claus whiskey cranberry cocktail because nesting for Christmas always makes me feel good \ud83d\ude0c\ud83c\udf84\n.\n.\nAll my blogger pals out there... what do you guys do to get past the lower days? Would love to hear your advice! \ud83d\ude18",
