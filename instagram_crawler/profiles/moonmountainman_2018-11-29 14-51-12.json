I have a lot to share from recent adventures so I\u2019ll do a little shift and try to post a lot more often here.\nWhat are we doing: we are back in WA and I just finished building out a few exciting (for me at least) updates on our van before we hit the road again for the next couple months in our home on wheels, Ivan. Our plan is to start driving south to Baja California to find the best Tacos \ud83c\udf2e\ud83e\udd24 (recommendations will be followed up on). Of course we will be taking our sweet time and doing a lot between here and there. Cheers.\nPhoto: Taken at Molas Lake, CO on our most recent road trip in Ivan."

In fact it was pretty much only something I did on Boy Scout trips, but my eyes were always drawn to the mountain tops. When I turned 26, a flip switched inside me, and I stopped waiting for the right time and other people to join me and I just began and haven\u2019t stopped since. As my love for the mountains grew I wanted to share it with others and a few times I\u2019ve been able to convince my parents to join me. This was one of those times. Although my parents (pictured) aren\u2019t really into hiking they came with me to Lake O\u2019Hara in the Canadian Rockies. We took some of the harder trails and they were dead tried but it was one of my most memorable times I\u2019ve spent with them and I dare say one of he highlights of theirs lives. I think this is especially true for my dad who I convinced to go on a mid night hike with an uncertain chance to see the northern lights. Beaten and tired he hiked and hobbled with me late into the night and just when we were about to give up, the sky exploded with color as the lights pulsed and danced in the sky."

This time has been unreal and the perfect way of life for me and my family. Life cost less, more freedom, exploring new places, family comfort while traveling for months on a the road, lots of time together and all while we do our work and make money (photography, writing, video)\nIt isn\u2019t for everyone but it is doable for anyone that wants.\nThis has been a dream that I\u2019ve been chasing for 6 years.\nWe are now currently back in WA, gearing up for our next trip. Our plan is to drive the coast from WA to Baja California to find the best Tacos and Sea Food the area has to offer \ud83e\udd24. With this worthy mission ahead of us if you\u2019ve got suggestions for anything let us know and if our paths cross, we\u2019d be happy to meet up. Cheers! And thank you for your continued support:"

When the fall colors are gone and the snow isn\u2019t deep enough to play in, what do you like to do outdoors?\nFor me it has often become a time to stay inside and work or travel. Sometimes I go north to find deep snow. Sometimes I go south to find the fall colors and pleasant temperatures. This year we are looking at traveling South.\nPhoto: taken last year of @rebornbyadventure near Lake O\u2019Hara in the Canadian Rockies."
