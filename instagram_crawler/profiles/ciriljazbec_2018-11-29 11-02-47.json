There was very heavy rainfall, and they were running to our camp from all possible corners of the mountain. Tshering told me to stay out of the way and be very careful with my movements.\nTshering and his family live in the camp five months a year and spend the rest in Laya. They have 20 male and 20 female yaks. While male yak is mainly used for transportation, ploughing field, clothing and tents, the female yak is mainly intended for milk.
