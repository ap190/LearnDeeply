The aim was to visit the Wegener Halv\u00f8 peninsula of East Greenland, where we had received a tip off that there were caves to be found. Our aim was to expand the vision of the Greenland Caves Project, to find these caves, explore them, and collect samples for palaeoclimate research. On the peninsula, we headed south to our second target, which looked more promising in the photographs than the ones the day before. We hiked across snow fields on steep ground and finally reached the bottom of the cliff at 6:30 p.m, after a long day. We were faced with a steep and loose scree slope and a final climb to the cave, which Chris made an attempt on while I flew the drone. Although these were definitely more cave-like than those from yesterday, they turned out to be large shelters without any sedimentary deposits. Another tiring and disappointing day. #EAGRE18 @Greenland_Caves"

Hamar women roll their locks with fat and red ochre (assile) and then twist them into crimson-colored dreds called goscha. Married and engaged women wear two heavy iron rings around their necks called esente, but if they are the first wife of a man, an additional torque with a phallic protrusion known as a binyere is worn. Women also decorate themselves with cowrie shells, glass, seed and metal beads, and wear beaded goat skin frocks that cover their upper body. As visitor numbers increase not only to the Hamar, but also to other tribes in the Omo, many believe this contact will undermine their cultural values, but the Hamar continue to marry only from within the tribe, and scorn those who refuse to take part in tribal ceremonies.

National Geographic Explorer, during which we encountered many different cetaceans, including this enormous pod of southern right whale dolphins porpoising at high speed.\n\nThe southern right whale dolphin (Lissodelphis peronii) is a small and slender species of mammal found in cool waters of the Southern Hemisphere. The species was named so because, like right whales, they lack a dorsal fin.\n\nThese animals generally travel in pods of fewer than 100 animals but may be seen in herds of more than 1,000 individuals. They are energetic swimmers that feed on a variety of fish species and squid and are often seen associating with dusky and hourglass dolphins, and pilot whales.\n\nTo see more more images shot #onassignment for @natgeoexpeditions in #southgeorgia, follow @jasperdoest\n\n#dolphins #cetacean #southernocean #natgeoexpeditions"

Hunting at night is their primary time as it is much cooler and their camouflaged coat becomes even more effective. They are undeniably voracious. Leopards are often seen rolling in urine and animal droppings. This may seem disgusting, but it's all done in an effort to mask their smell from prey.

All the pieces are there, and largely functioning together as they have for millennia. There are a few chinks\u2014declining king salmon populations come to mind\u2014but this is really intact system and something not to be taken for granted.\" As a result of his vision, and forward-thinking style, we're working together to show you the life of some of the animals living in this amazing place.
