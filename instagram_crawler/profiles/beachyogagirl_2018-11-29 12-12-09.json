In fact, most of my life, I felt marriage was nothing but a system of control and would only eventually hurt you. I was lucky enough however, to marry an alcoholic who found recovery. Yes, lucky... extremely blessed beyond belief.\n\u2800\nI talk about this from time to time, but around the holidays, I know it can be really hard for some who may not have come to terms yet with their or someone else\u2019s disease of addiction.\n\u2800\nI have addiction in my family (who doesn\u2019t, right?) and yes, I also married someone who suffered from this progressive, horrible disease. It steals people\u2019s lives away - in plain sight - and everyone blames the victim. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just stop?!\u201d That\u2019s what I use to think until I also got help for my part in the disease. It took some deep inner healing and education to understand this monster of a disease. To this day, finding recovery was the best thing I\u2019ve ever done or will do for the rest of my life. I\u2019m so grateful to God, and for those who helped me along the way. I am also so grateful for my husband, who just celebrated 10 years of sobriety! \ud83c\udf89 He is my best friend, my boo, my carpenter, my fixer of all things, my provider, and the best father I could have asked for to my 2 sons.\n\u2800\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing in this photo\ud83d\ude02, but my husband looks hot \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude0d, so I\u2019d like to honor him today.\ud83d\ude09 He is my walking miracle and proof that \u201cit works if you work it!\u201d\n\u2800\nI love you, baby! Thank you for showing me that marriage can be EASY when you just focus on doing the next right thing.\n\ud83d\ude18\n\u2800\n@inlovewithbeachyogagirl\n#grateful #inlove #143 #marriageisntwork #iglove #12steps\n\u2800"

I also haven\u2019t gone to the grocery store in weeks and #confession, I\u2019ve been living off frozen French fries and a bag of dried cranberries all week.\n\u2800\nMy laundry is piled up (clean but not put away... I\u2019m not sure it ever gets put away. We kind of live off the top of the basket \ud83d\ude02! Am I the only one?) and my dishwasher just broke, so I\u2019ve been avoiding that part of the house hoping somehow the dishes will clean themselves.\n\u2800\nMy kids however, are clean, fed, and homework is done, so I consider that #winning at the Mom thing today. Do you agree?\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc66\u200d\ud83d\udc66\n\u2800\nI may be tired and feeling overwhelmed, but I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. I love my family and I also love working. Maybe if I didn\u2019t work the house would be cleaner and everything would be \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc, but then I\u2019d have no need for this post\ud83d\ude09. \u2800\nPS: Tomorrow I\u2019m filming for my Playbook App!

Somehow I know if we lived close to each other, we\u2019d be the best of friends.\n\u2800\nInstagram can be sometimes full of people trying to get \u201clikes\u201d by showing more than they should or doing things just \u201cfor the gram\u201d but Erin is just Erin and I love that.\n\u2800\nIf you are looking for inspiring content that makes you feel something, check her out. @erintron \u2800\n#repost @erintron \ud83c\udfb6 Song: Walls | @kingsofleon"

I love combining effective sequencing to train multiple parts of the body at once. This class is a perfect example and really has helped my hamstring flexibility as well!\n\u2800\nIf you would like to take the full class, download my Playbook app (active link in profile)! \ud83e\udd33\ud83c\udffb You can take the 7 day free trial and unlock all of my programs and classes. This class is called \u201cWeighted Quick Core Slimdown\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\u201d under my Quick Core Workouts.\n\u2800\nWould you guys be interested in me doing weekly #QuickCore workouts on Instagram Live?

It seems like there is just so much more to do and so little time to do it all. There also seems to be so many more people out on the road and in stores that it makes everything harder.\n\u2800\nFor me, it becomes very stressful no matter how hard I try to appreciate and enjoy it - the tree, decorating, holiday parties, shopping, wrapping, and mailing gifts...\n\u2800\nI\u2019ve tried to say no to it all but my husband likes it, so I do my best to smile through it.\ud83d\ude01\n\u2800\nAnnnnnd... is it me or does it seem like people are way more sensitive and easily aggravated this time of year? #stirsupcrazy\n\u2800\nSo are you someone who loves this holiday season or are you more like me and wish we could just skip it?\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\u2800\n#holidaylove #santaclaus\ud83c\udf85 #cartwheel #yoga #handstandpractice"
