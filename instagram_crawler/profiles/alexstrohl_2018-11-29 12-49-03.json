Been waiting for years for this moment! A couple things I noticed:\n1. The scale of this valley is nigh on impossible to show in photos\n2. They\u2019ve done an impressive job at hiding the roads, parking lots and hotels. You can barely see them from high up.\n3. Everyone is constantly looking up at the walls around.\n4. I feel like the best way to experience this valley would be to walk its entire length with a few close buddies."

It was ridge-line after ridge-ligne, deep blue pools in the ice, for miles. Basically a dream. But what will outlast any memory from that flight is this small lake on the way back to the airfield. It summed up the immensity of the Yukon for me."
