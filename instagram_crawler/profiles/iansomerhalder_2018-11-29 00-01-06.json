The IS Green award we give every year enables these young women to build upon these stories and create actionable change in their communities. Thank you to all of our incredible donors who came to spend the evening with us last night and for supporting our collective mission. And to the beautiful @thechaispotnyc for hosting us and reminding us to slow down over a cup of chai, connecting with one another in this beautiful space you\u2019ve created. Thanks honey aka @nikkireed for snapping this photo for me to use ;)"

This thing has change my life and I\u2019m so grateful that my dear friends at @sunlightensaunas have created such special healing equipment to make our lives and our health better. If you have any doubt of the incredible healing properties of these infrared saunas just check out what they do. It\u2019s not just the heat but the light therapy and the sound resonance therapy. Mind blowing... They are helping people feel better and therefore act better to the world that surrounds them and that is such a cool thing."

Me as @drlutherswannofficial I\u2019m so humbled by the complex abilities of the cast, crew and Producers/Network/Studio of this show. We did it. It\u2019s in the can as they say... Now it\u2019s time for us, as producers to bring it to life in the editing room and digital effects suite. Thank you @netflix and @idwpublishing for this incredible opportunity. We poured our hearts into this. All you have to do as an audience; is watch. Even if you don\u2019t like it ;) I\u2019d like another crack at a SEASON 2. There are so many places to take this story I want another shot. Let me get into the details with our amazing team to make this a hit show; but I\u2019m going to need you to check it out to see if you jive with it. It\u2019s so very relevant to this modern, social, digital, political and emotional landscape that we all find ourselves all navigating and traversing together. To my team: thank you all for your tireless efforts and talent. I\u2019m humbled to lead the charge of this show into the public sphere. Every second of post production and every interview you will be there with me- the work of many hot Sudbury days to freezing Toronto nights. To our audience: I hope we can move you with grounded, nuanced performances and story with the time allotted for us to tell it. We tried. We will keep trying if you can give us the chance. There is an immense amount of TV out there- we hope you our frequency resonates with you.\nWith immense gratitude to this group and to our audience,\nIan. Here some important handles to follow for more info: @drlutherswannofficial aka Dr. Luther Swann (me). #vwars @vwarsnetflix @vwars @vwarsofficial"

I\u2019m catching a nap cuddled with my #vwarsnetflix script in the middle of emails, conference calls and texts for VWars, my soon-to-be-launching wine company, my production company, my nutraceutical company, @gogreenequipment and a global communication technology company- strategizing it all from my office in the sky- on the amazing @wheelsup8760 #KingAir350i made by my friends at @textronaviation . I\u2019m so grateful to the @beechcraft family of engineers for designing the safest, most efficient and greenest turboprop in the world. The KingAir was green, before green was cool. That\u2019s why so many use it. It\u2019s American engineering at its finest and I\u2019m proud that my partners and companies only use @wheelsup8760 & @textronaviation home to @beechcraft & @cessnacitation . Thank to all for keeping me safe and thank you #wheelsup8760 for giving us access to so many of these amazing planes with your combined reliability and safety. When I was a little boy on a bayou in Louisiana, I could have only dreamed of being this busy, this blessed and being surrounded by this much love and ingenuity in the most pivotal time in human history. Hard work, integrity, innovation and compassion is what I\u2019m striving for. I\u2019m trying so very hard to build successful and sustainable for-profit companies to then be able to reinvest those resources back into education to build stronger communities and build a better world for us all and our children... The future of business MUST have a triple bottom line: People. Planet. Profit.\nWith immense gratitude to you all,\nIan\n#textronaviation #upthewayyoufly #wheelsup8760 #kingairnation #kingair350i"

I took this in the mirror of Damon\u2019s dressing room to remember how worn down I was but smiling- That\u2019s a nebulizer I\u2019m sucking on-shooting pharmaceutical hydrogen peroxide into my lungs to keep from collapsing from an infection. Supplements, oxygen chambers flying around like a maniac making a TV show and trying to build companies while building @isfofficial . Be careful. Ambition can be dangerous... I\u2019ve found this image and wanted to share it. We\u2019ve lost amazing men and women recently who really helped change the world but their bodies perished from the pressure and abuse of running too hard and not taking care of themselves. I\u2019m humbly searching for that balance and I wish you all luck in finding it. Meditation helps, I use transcendental mediation or TM- it\u2019s super easy. Just remember this- we don\u2019t actually need much to live happy lives. We, as humans firmly believe more and more and more and more \u201cthings\u201d will make us happy. Unfortunately they don\u2019t make us happy. Our buying patterns just fuels economies ... Our kids deserve to grow up not seeing us staring at these little glowing devices in our hands. I hide around corners and under pillows so my little one doesn\u2019t see it... Our babies need us present to teach them and to listen to them. It\u2019s the only way to build a loving and sustainable society. At least that\u2019s what I think- take it or leave it;)"

Day before shooting season 7 of The Vampire Diaries. Every season I would take a \u201cself portrait\u201d to document the change in who I was after a summer of literally flying around the world meeting so many of you while experiencing this incredible journey ... So much has changed since then. So much growth, so much experience and pushing myself to do more- I truly look forward to sharing these new things I\u2019ve been building: Wine, nutraceuticals, new TV and ISF @isfofficial Thank you all for so much support. Thank you so very much.\nAll the love and thanks in the world to you,\nIan"

When I was a little boy flying in my uncle\u2019s Cessna I found my love of flying and my love of the sky. I always dreamed of flying around the world and now for my work, I live in the sky. Some are short flights and some long, but they are a great many in number. Mostly to see you all! I\u2019m shooting #VWars right now and I\u2019m so bummed that I missed hanging this week in Florida with my @wheelsup8760 and my @textronaviation family at the #nbaa18 (National Business Aviation Association) @nbaaphotos this year- I WILL make it next year. I can\u2019t wait to see the innovation and artistry of these amazing machines. We have a hard and long road to push in the sustainability realm of aviation both on the business and commercial sides. Revolutionizing efficiency and fuels is the way of the future... it\u2019s a MUST for our planet. I live on this thing so me and my team feel so safe and grateful to @textronaviation for building them and @wheelsup8760 for having such a huge fleet of them- giving us access to move around safely and efficiently."

To our FIREFIGHTERS: We are so grateful for you today and everyday. We love and respect you immensely. To all of our Police and other the 1st responders, emergency professionals and volunteers that went in to save people, homes and animals we thank you from the deepest depths of our hearts. We thank each and every one of you to the stars and back. The @losangelesfiredepartment , you are among the greatest heroes on this planet and your bravery and commitment to protecting our state, our people and our creatures is so powerful and so appreciated. Thank you @lafdfoundation for supporting them. From my family to yours, we thank you all on this day. We can only hope that all those affected by natural disasters this year and in recent years find some happiness and a hug today. Hope is all we have to move forward in these terrible moments but together as community we are strong and can share smiles. I send you all love today and applaud your strength and courage to press on. May we start to talk more seriously about where the increasing number of violent hurricanes and fires, that are destroying our homes and communities are coming from and together pave a road to a more peaceful and less destructive future.\nHappy Thanksgiving to all and may today not be about gluttonous consumption but gratitude for the simple things in life, the things that we need to survive: Family, friends and food.\nWith immense gratitude,\nIan Somerhalder"
