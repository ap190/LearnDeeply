They snorkel, sit on the beach, walk around Fort Jefferson, and then head back to Key West when the ferry horn blows. I get the need for a quick trip, but whenever possible we like to explore much deeper. We camped for three nights on the island, and the difference between when the tourists were there and when we nearly had the island to ourselves was amazing. We looked at the boat docking in the morning as the time where we would stop exploring and just chill out. But when the boat left with all the tourists, we continued our exploration...and it was awesome. We made friends with the rangers (who invited us to dinner), did a nighttime scorpion walk in the fort, watched the sunset and sunrise from atop the fort, and just had a blast. Yeah, it\u2019s more work and a bit of a hassle to bring all your food, water, and camping gear on the boat. But we so appreciated the extra time once we were there. We left having a deep appreciation for the park, the rangers, and the incredible ecosystem above and below water. Whenever possible, and even when it is more difficult, explore deeper. \u00b7\n@DryTortugasNPS (the 51st U.S. National Park) in Florida was established by the @NationalParkService on October 26, 1992.\n\u00b7\nStay tuned as @istefpayne and I count down all 60 of the U.S. national parks, sharing previously untold stories and/or photos from our epic road trip to visit all the parks during the 2016 centennial of the park service #onassignment for @natgeo and @fujifilm_northamerica.\n\u00b7\nWhile we are counting down, you can get your hands on a copy of our gorgeous 240-page National Park coffee table book for 25% off!

One of the things that kept us going under such crazy project time and content demands was the time we allocated to NOT working..to simply playing and having fun. It was never a lot of time that we spent just playing, but it was enough to get our minds off the deadlines and remember to find joy in little things. Just enough to fill our proverbial cups back up. In American Samoa NP, we fulfilled our play time by joining the locals (our new friends) for one of their favorite activities...jumping off the bridge between islands into the warm pacific waters. The bridge wasn\u2019t terribly high, but just enough to get your heart going when you stood at the edge. And when you felt the weightlessness of the free fall followed by the warm, salty water enveloping you as you entered, it was pure joy. It only lasted an hour or so, but that refresher kept us going for a long time.

In particular, I love that their weather sealing is so good, and that they built in a fantastic interval timer into the system menu. These two elements allowed me to get much needed sleep during a project that did not allow for much downtime, while also still being able to capture the stars at night. Here\u2019s how it worked: I\u2019d setup the camera on a tripod (in a relatively hidden place near our campsite) just as the sun was starting to sink. Through the use of iPhone apps (like my all time favorite @PhotoPills) I\u2019d know exactly where the Milky Way was going to be, at the exact time, and I could easily setup the shot I wanted the camera to take at 2 or 3 in the morning. I\u2019d then set the interval timer on a delay to wake up the camera at the appropriate time, and take a certain number of images (like 100 or 150)...all while I was fast asleep in my sleeping bag. I sometimes had two or three different cameras on tripods setup in different nearby locations. I\u2019d wake up, fully rested for the day, having great images of the night sky. Brilliant! Did I worry about the cameras getting stolen? yeah, sometimes. But covering the tripod and camera with some nearby brush usually hid them well enough. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this trick to everyone as there is certainly a moderate risk of camera loss, but it was a lifesaver for me on this crazy yearlong project. The dry, desert climate and clear open skies of Joshua Tree NP makes it a great place try this trick. \u00b7\n@JoshuaTreeNPS (the 54th U.S. National Park) in California was established by the @NationalParkService on October 31, 1994.\n\u00b7\nStay tuned as @istefpayne and I count down all 60 of the U.S. national parks, sharing previously untold stories and/or photos from our epic road trip to visit all the parks during the 2016 centennial of the park service #onassignment for @natgeo and @fujifilm_northamerica.\n\u00b7\nWhile we are counting down, you can get your hands on a copy of our gorgeous 240-page National Park coffee table book for 25% off!

Whenever I am wandering in nature, I always have one eye on the rocks below and above (if there are mountains). I\u2019ve traveled with geologists in remote places, and I am always amazed at how they can read the landscape simply by having an understanding of rocks and the underlying geological processes. Pinnacles National Park is a fantastic park for the study of rocks, and in particular, how they relate to tectonic plate movement. Pinnacles is located in central California, on the San Andreas fault (where the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate meet). Forged by volcanic eruptions and fire, the \u201cpinnacle\u201d rocks were split in two by the San Andreas fault. How do we know this? Through geology, it is evident that the rocks on the west side of the fault moved 195 miles north (at a rate of 3-5 centimeters a year). When we visited Pinnacles at the end of our road trip, I remember being blown away by the fact that the rocks before my eyes had been moved almost 200 miles away by tectonic plate movement, and if you were to travel those 200 miles you\u2019d find the same exact rocks.

Out of the 59 national parks we visited, there are three parks that I feel I didn\u2019t capture them at their best. All told, that\u2019s a relatively small number...but still.

On a yearlong project that had to deal with some seriously difficult seasonality issues, we just couldn\u2019t visit Cuyahoga Valley NP at an optimal time. But I still think we got some nice photos, had some fantastic experiences, and learned why this park is a special one. In the end, I\u2019m ok with what I consider my suboptimal coverage, because under the circumstances we did our very best.

I\u2019ll never forget this storm rolling in to Great Basin National Park. It was sunny not long before this, and you can still see the sun peaking through a small hole in the clouds. But this weather front moved in so quickly that it changed from a rather nice afternoon to an ominous early evening in no time at all. I remember parking the truck (or as we like to call him, \u201cBuck\u201d..named after the dog from the book Call of the Wild) and standing out on the plains feeling the crazy rush of wind and storm move in. It was a powerful feeling that I can still remember so well to this day. \u00b7\n@GreatBasinNPS (the 49th U.S. National Park) in Nevada was established by the @NationalParkService on October 27, 1986.\n\u00b7\nStay tuned as @istefpayne and I count down all 60 of the U.S. national parks, sharing previously untold stories and/or photos from our epic road trip to visit all the parks during the 2016 centennial of the park service #onassignment for @natgeo and @fujifilm_northamerica.\n\u00b7\nWhile we are counting down, you can get your hands on a copy of our gorgeous 240-page National Park coffee table book for 25% off!

You don\u2019t really need to have a goal or purpose in mind, but simply being out there and present sets the stage for magic to happen. It doesn\u2019t always happen, and even when you don\u2019t come away from a photowalk with great images you are still left with the positive and healing experience of being out in nature. But sometimes, magic does happen. One of my favorite memories from Saguaro NP was talking an hour photo walk by myself directly out into a field of giant cacti just as the sun was setting. Wandering in the golden light among these giants was glorious. At one point, several coyotes ran past me, barely paying me any attention. And then I found this hummingbird buzzing around the cacti, and managed to get a nice silhouette shot. It was such a fun photo walk, and it all happened because I decided to show up. \u00b7\n@saguaronationalpark (the 52nd U.S. National Park) in Arizona was established by the @NationalParkService on October 14, 1994.\n\u00b7\nStay tuned as @istefpayne and I count down all 60 of the U.S. national parks, sharing previously untold stories and/or photos from our epic road trip to visit all the parks during the 2016 centennial of the park service #onassignment for @natgeo and @fujifilm_northamerica.\n\u00b7\nWhile we are counting down, you can get your hands on a copy of our gorgeous 240-page National Park coffee table book for 25% off!

                        "comment": "When I am teaching photography in workshops or expeditions, I get asked the following question a lot: \u201dWhat lens should I use today?\u201d While I can always provide a recommendation or two, it\u2019s a question that is hard to answer as the world of photography is infinite and it really depends on what you want to photograph. One thing I can promise is that, if you can only choose one lens, you will almost certainly have a moment where you think to yourself that you should have chosen the other lens. Don\u2019t worry, it happens to me too. How do I get around this dilemma? I almost always carry two camera bodies with two different lenses (a wide angle and a telephoto) attached. There are a lot of practical reasons for this (like not wanting to change lenses in dusty environments, quicker reaction times, etc), but it comes down to being ready for whatever scene catches my eye. You might not think that having a telephoto lens in the beautiful Great Sand Dunes would be a smart lens choice, but when you see that hiker on the distant sand dune, a wide angle lens isn\u2019t going to cut it. Best to be prepared, even though I know that is not possible for everyone (too expensive, too heavy, etc). If that is the case, take solace in the fact that using one lens, and adapting it to whatever situation comes along, will make you a better photographer. It\u2019s not about the gear, it\u2019s about your eye.\n\u00b7\n@GreatSandDunesNPS (the 58th U.S. National Park) was established by the @NationalParkService on September 13, 2004.\n\u00b7\nStay tuned as @istefpayne and I count down all 60 of the U.S. national parks, sharing previously untold stories and/or photos from our epic road trip to visit all the parks during the 2016 centennial of the park service #onassignment for @natgeo and @fujifilm_northamerica.\n\u00b7\nWhile we are counting down, you can get your hands on a copy of our gorgeous 240-page National Park coffee table book for 25% off!
