The photograph is from my long-term project, book and exhibit \u2018Sleeping Cars\u2019. Cars are the blood in the veins of LA. They rest against backgrounds of varying ambient light on the winding streets of the Hollywood Hills to the flat gridded suburbs of the Valley. Nestled in the low-lying fog or mysterious side streets of LA neighborhoods, the vehicles begin to take on personalities of their own. Each car\u2019s distinct surroundings create a different tableau that is meant to tempt the viewer to construct his/her own narrative behind each vehicle.\n\nEven after the publication of my fine-art photo book, I occasionally continue to photograph resting cars at night.

Since I was competing with the legendary Ernst Haas and one of my idols at the time, Thomas H\u00f6pker, I did not expect to stand a chance \u2013 but I was chosen.\nSo I spent a couple of weeks with Hundertwasser at his huge, rugged and remote property in the Bay of Islands, an area on the northeast coast of the North Island of New Zealand. Hundertwasser had a wicked kind of humor. In order to get his permission to take this picture, I had to promise that I would bathe after him \u2013 without changing the water. Which I did \u2013 but it was definitely one of the shortest baths I ever took.\nFriedensreich Regentag Dunkelbunt Hundertwasser (1928-2000), born Friedrich Stowasser, was a world renowned eccentric artist, architect and environmentalist.Concerned early on about the environment, he designed houses with grass roofs, undulating floors, and onion-shaped domes. In his art and architecture he used bright colors and organic forms, was fascinated by spirals, and considered straight lines as \u2018immoral and godless\u2019. For this flash sale the photograph is printed on an archival 8.5x11 inch Legacy Platine paper with an actual image size of 6x9 inch. It is signed with an archival marker on the front border. Large limited edition prints of this image are in several private collections.\n\nThe flash sale ends on December 4th. All prints are shipped via USPS priority mail.\n\nGo to the link in my bio to purchase the print.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeocreative #Hundertwasser #artist #Newzealand #flashsale #bathing"

Only then the children were hastily  evacuated and had to leave everything behind \u2013 even their treasured dolls and toys.\n\nThe photograph was shot on assignment for National Geographic Magazine in 2005 and is a key image of my ongoing Chernobyl project.

At 1:23 am on April 26, 1986 reactor #4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant blew up. The radioactive fallout spread over thousands of square kilometers, driving more than a quarter of a million people permanently from their homes. More than 100,000 people may have succumbed to Chernobyl-related illnesses. With more radiation released than in Fukushima, it caused the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster to date.\n\nIn 2011, the Ukrainian government legalized trips to the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Chernobyl has since become a disaster-tourism destination.\n\nThe most riveting attraction for visitors is the ghost town of Pripyat. Formerly home to almost 50,000 people, Pripyat is now in decay: dolls are scattered in abandoned kindergartens, floors are rotting, paint is peeling from the walls, and gas masks litter evacuated schools.\n\nMore than three decades later, tourists and guides are creating a bewildering disturbance, as they assemble tableaux to illustrate the flight from disaster. The most repeated motif: a doll neatly arranged next to a gas mask, or like here, a doll wearing a gas mask! The ever-falling chips of chalk from the ceilings have blanketed some of these \u201cstill-lifes,\u201d furthering the illusion for the next visitor that this is how the evacuees hastily abandoned the scene. With so many rearranged scenes\u2014many of the same themes repeated\u2014the uncritical observer may believe these sights to be an authentic representation of the disaster\u2019s aftermath.\n\nYou can learn more about Chernobyl from my book The Long Shadow of Chernobyl.\n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative #Chernobyl #Pripyat #abandoned  #radiation #doll #gasmask #LongShadowofChernobyl"

As a young photographer I spent a couple of weeks with the world renowned Austrian artist at his huge, rugged and remote property in the native forest located in the Bay of Islands, an area on the northeast coast of New Zealand.\n\nFriedensreich Regentag Dunkelbunt Hundertwasser (1928-2000), born Friedrich Stowasser, was a world renowned eccentric artist, architect and environmentalist. Concerned early on about the environment, he designed houses with grass roofs, undulating floors, and onion-shaped domes. In his art and architecture he used bright colors and organic forms, was fascinated by spirals, and considered straight lines as \u2018immoral and godless\u2019. See the image I posted last month of him taking a bath in his makeshift tub in the native forest of New Zealand\n\n@thephotosociety #hundertwasser #artist #portrait"

Homegrown tomatoes in the kitchen sink of Ivan and his wife Gapa, who have returned to their contaminated village inside the Chernobyl nuclear Exclusion Zone.\nIn 1986, roughly 350,000 people were forced to evacuate after the explosion in reactor #4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plan contaminated thousands of square miles. In 2005, at the time I took this photograph, disaster be damned, some 400 elderly people had returned. At first Ukrainian officials discouraged them. But when it became clear they meant to die on their contaminated soil - instead of a broken heart in anonymous city suburbs - medical care and other services were provided by the authorities. The couple has since passed, but an estimated 150 returnees still live out their lives inside the contaminated Exclusion Zone.\nIn her book \u2018Voices from Chernobyl\u2019 Nobel Prize laureate Svetlana Alexievich  quotes one of the returnees, \u201cNo one is going to fool us anymore, we\u2019re not moving anywhere. There\u2019s no store, no hospital. No electricity. We sit next to a kerosene lamp and under the moonlight. And we like it! Because we\u2019re home.\u201d @ thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative #Chernobyl #ExclusionZone #returnees #nuclear"
