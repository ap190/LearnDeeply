Black holes can be large or small\u2026just like the lines in all of the stores today. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain! So how do black holes form? Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began. Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star collapses. When this happens, it causes a supernova.\n\nParallel jets provide astronomers with some of the most powerful evidence that a supermassive black hole lurks in the heart of most galaxies. Some of these black holes appear to be active, gobbling up material from their surroundings and launching jets at ultra-high speeds, while others are quiescent, even dormant.\n\nThis artist\u2019s conception of the core of an active galaxy shows the dusty donut-shaped surroundings, called a torus, and jets launching from its center. Magnetic fields are illustrated trapping the dust in the torus. These magnetic fields could be helping power the black hole hidden in the galaxy\u2019s core by confining the dust in the torus and keeping it close enough to be gobbled up by the hungry black hole.\n\nCredit: NASA/@SOFIAtelescope/Lynette Cook\n#nasa #space #astronomy #blackfriday #blackhole #science #galaxy #stars"

The gravity of the cluster bends light coming from behind it in a similar way to how the base of a wine glass bends light. The effects of this lensing can be clearly seen as curved streaks forming a circular shape around the center of the frame. Astronomers can use these distorted galaxies to calculate the mass of the cluster \u2014 including the mass of the dark matter within it \u2014 and to peer deeper into the universe than otherwise possible. Gravitational lensing not only distorts the views of galaxies, it also enlarges their appearance in the sky and magnifies their light.\n\nHubble has viewed gravitational lensing many times and produced truly stunning images. Astronomers even set up a dedicated program called Frontier Fields to study different galaxy clusters that show a great number of lensed galaxies. Some of the most distant galaxies in the universe were found this way. With each additional cluster observed, more distant galaxies are added to this list, slowly completing our picture of how galaxies looked and evolved in the early universe.\n\nCredit: @europeanspaceagency & NASA\n\n#nasa #space #hubble #spothubble #spacetelescope #telescope #galaxy #cluster #gravity #lensing #beautiful #universe #solarsystem #science #bright #distortion #phenomenon"

Unlike other blackwater rivers, it maintains its inky color along its entire 250-mile journey to the sea.\n\nWhen the river finally meets the Gulf of Mexico along Florida\u2019s Big Bend\u2014that portion of coast where the state\u2019s panhandle curves to meet its peninsula\u2014its dark waters act like a tracer, revealing whereby the river water mixes with the sea.\n\nTo understand the color of the Suwannee River, you have to start at its source. In Georgia\u2019s boggy Okefenokee Swamp, the peat deposits are so extensive that the ground quivers with every step.\n\nIt is in this swamp that the nascent Suwannee River first encounters large amounts of decaying vegetation. As these leaves, branches, and bark decay, the tannins that once protected the vegetation dissolve into a substance that dyes the river a brown so dark that it borders on black. The amount of dark dissolved organic matter, or humic substances, in the Suwannee River is nearly ten times higher than other streams around the world.\n\nOur satellite view from the vantage point of space helps us increase our understanding of our home planet, improve lives, and safeguard our future.\n\nCredit: @NASAEarth\n\n#nasa #space #earth #homeplanet #satellite #views #organic #rivers #water #science #earthviews #picoftheday"

As gas and dust compress to form stars, the gas around these areas heats up and pressurizes\u2014giving the appearance of bubbles. Radiation from the hot stars also causes these bubbles to glow brightly. Spitzer is an infrared telescope, which can help us see through thick clouds of gas and dust in ways our eyes cannot.

While galaxy clusters can contain hundreds or even thousands of individual galaxies, the lion's share of mass in a galaxy cluster comes from hot gas, which gives off X-rays, and unseen dark matter.\nImage credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/INAF/A.

Seen by the Hubble Space Telescope (@NASAHubble), it hosts an extremely rich population of star clusters making it an ideal laboratory for investigating star formation.\nDiscovered in November 1834 by British astronomer John Herschel, NGC 1898 has been scrutinized numerous times by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. Today we know that globular clusters are some of the oldest known objects in the universe and that they are relics of the first epochs of galaxy formation. While we already have a pretty good picture on the globular clusters of the Milky Way \u2014 still with many unanswered questions \u2014 our studies on globular clusters in nearby dwarf galaxies just started. The observations of NGC 1898 will help to determine whether their properties are similar to the ones found in the Milky Way, or if they have different features, due to being in a different cosmic environment.\n\nImage Credit: ESA/Hubble & NASA\n#nasa #space #hubble #spothubble #spacetelescope #telescope #cluster #star #galaxy #universe #solarsystem #largemagellaniccloud #science"

Cygnus will deliver about 7,500 pounds of science, supplies and hardware to the @ISS and its crew. Liftoff is currently targeted for 4:01 a.m. ET on Saturday, Nov. 17. If skies are clear, many on the East Coast will be able to look up and see the launch.\n\nCredit: NASA/Joel Kowsky\n\n#nasa #spacestation #northropgrumman #cygnus #antares #wallopsisland #nasawallops #wallops #rocket"
