Together we instilled a sense of pride in the natural heritage of local young people in Kenya and Botswana. Together we watched as once skittish lions and elephants returned to the Sapi Reserve in Zimbabwe. Together we made an impact for conservation in Africa.\nIt is days like today that we take stock of the incredible journey a year can be and the accomplishments achieved through a shared vision. Thank you for sharing Great Plains\u2019s vision for a brighter future for Africa\u2019s wild places.\n#conservation #goodnewsconservation #wildlife #rhinos"

When lion cubs are not asleep or feeding, they're playing - behaviour that gradually teaches them the best way to stalk, pounce and catch; essentially how to become a successful predator. Anyone who has raised a kitten knows that when they are very young they haven't fully gained control over the amount of pressure they put into their claws and can often inadvertently puncture or scratch while they play. Lion cubs are just the same and @dereckjoubert and I often wince seeing them scrambling over one of the adults like an ice climber with pickaxes. The adults are remarkably patient with their young explorers but will shake them off or bat them with a restraining paw if the assault carries on for too long. #Okavangolions #TsaroPride #littlebigcats"

These mounds are hugely important in this ecosystem. While termites play an important role in breaking down dead vegetation, their towering mounds provide homes to a number of animals - from warthogs to aardvarks. When termites emerge after the rains in millions - winging their way across the landscape, they feed many species of birds, reptiles and mammals - even sometimes lions. The mounds also supply important dry ground when the system floods, shade during the heat of the day and an excellent vantage point for predators to survey the landscape and plan their next hunt. This little lion has a long way to go until he takes down his first lechwe, but from a good vantage point he'll be able to watch his mother and aunts as they hunt - and he will learn. #littlebigcats #okavangolions #TsaroPride #DubaPlains"
