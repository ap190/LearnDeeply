The heaviest of the erected statues weigh an astonishing 86 tonnes. 900 of the statues were erected on an island barely 15 miles long. By the time of European contact all 900 statues had been toppled in some social upheaval. I look at the statues as the art work that punctuates one of the greatest feats of exploration human have ever accomplished. Rapa Nui is amazingly remote. There are no other inhabited islands for nearly 2,000 miles in any direction. Sometime around 900 CE the founders of Rapa Nui set out from their home islands in Polynesia in open decked sailing canoes. They not only found this incredibly remote land but then guided only by the stars and their knowledge of the ocean returned to their homeland, packed up all that they would need to begin a new existence in a place thousands of miles away and set out to find Rapa Nui once again. It was an amazing act of human accomplishment. #respect #rapanui shot on assignment for @natgeoexpeditions"

Huge Respect! 750 miles, 13 months, eight pairs of shoes, two friends and one camera to document our iconic national park \u2013 the Grand Canyon. The story of this transect through the length of the only canyon visible from outer space is now available in the pages of a new book: The Grand Canyon; Between River and Rim. I am thrilled to see this come to life in time for the park\u2019s 100thbirthday next year. See rare vantages of this roofless cathedral but also learn how it\u2019s at risk to change. Portions of the proceeds support the Grand Canyon Association, which helps protect the park.Thanks to @Rizzolibooks #hamptonsides #kevinfedarko for helping see this marathon reach bookstores near you.

I've seen hand prints on 6 continents and across all ages of human history. That urge to record our passing in a permanent way, to make art, is innately human. That urge inspired me to create the nonprofit @ancientartarchive. In the time before written language -most of human history- our stories were recorded on rock and cave walls around the planet. We are in a race to preserve humanity's oldest stories before they disappear to climate change, population pressure and mismanagement. This #givingtuesday follow the link in @ancientartarchive bio to join and help us preserve humanity's oldest stories."

Monks gather for two hours a day to discuss the finer points of Tibetan Buddhist philosophy. Correct answers are met with a hand clamp, wrong ones are met with humor and teasing. #Lhasa"

The fire dance traces its roots back to a Polynesian warrior dance seen in different forms across the Pacific Islands. Fire is a relatively late addition to the traditional demonstration of a warriors strength and skill. The speed and precision that the dancers move with their burning torches is impressive as is the dedication that goes into producing the dance.\n\nShot on assignment for @natgeoexpeditions #Samoa #Firedance"
