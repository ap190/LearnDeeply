Think cozy warm tones, crisp leaves and smooth detailed skies! AHH THIS IS CRAZY! It might seem like such a small thing, but photography and editing has been a passion of mine for years! I started photography when I was 14, went to college for it and always pursued it as my main passion. So giving a part of my passion to you guys means a lot to me. Since you all ask how I edit my photos, well, here ya go! This preset pack is available on sale until Tuesday and then it\u2019ll be at its regular price on my blog. Each season I\u2019ll release a new set! If you use them please tag #JLPresets so I can share your pics! \u2764\ufe0f"
