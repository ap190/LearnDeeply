With the dunes sitting at almost 9,000ft elevation and storms constantly passing through it made sense. But with a little research the truth came out that these black patches were in fact magnetite that had eroded from the nearby mountain range. The iron oxide mineral could even be picked up with a magnet. Still so much mystery here."

They became a new obstacle to avoid when deep water soloing in Mallorca. This photo was created with a large dome port on a water-housing often referred to as an over/under port. We used a fisheye lens that allows you to capture a portal to two separate worlds. In this case myself & @nathaniel.coleman switched places & he dove while I climbed.\n@_ryanhill_ held his breath and waited patiently for the water to be calm at the surface while shooting this photo. Pretty sure he even got stung by a jellyfish while doing so."

The ability to have something hold our attention & drive us to learn more about it. Photographs should in many ways just perpetuate & stoke the fire of curiosity.\nYou may see a perfect volcano in this image, but all I see is that crater, middle right of the frame, i can\u2019t stop thinking about it. We didn\u2019t have the time explore it & drawn to know and understand how it got there... these are the healthy obsessions I live for."
