The future is for the young\u2019ns but in my home state, 75+ year olds outvote the youth 10-to-1. I\u2019d love to see this ballot decided by who\u2019s going to protect the environment first and foremost. It ain\u2019t gonna clean itself and there\u2019s no second planet...yet. In less than two decades from now, there is expected to be a greater volume of garbage in the ocean than fish life. We need to act now and there is no penalty for being overly cautious about our impacts. Florida, in particular, has suffered at the hands of business and political interests ahead of our natural resources...our main attraction. This past Summer and into the Fall, we experienced the worst fish die-offs and algal blooms in memory. Not trying to preach to anyone but please consider who has made these topics a priority when you cast your ballot. We are likely close to a tipping point at this time in history. \u270c\ud83c\udffd"

If you\u2019ve got a good Andy Irons story, please share it below. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nWhen I found out Andy had passed, I was with a few friends on a beach in Puerto Rico playing with a homeless dog. My manager had the dog rescued and brought to CA where it was adopted by an Orange County surfing family (@griffin_foy). We soon found out she was pregnant, and she gave birth to a healthy litter. There\u2019s a metaphor in there somewhere. Andy and I had some otherworldly connections but I know he had that with a lot of people, sometimes in misunderstood ways. He was a giant personality and presence that we all can\u2019t help but feel the void of. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffd"
