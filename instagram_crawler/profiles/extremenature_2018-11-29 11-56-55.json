We were lucky enough to observe infant green monkeys feeding and being carried around the Barbados Wildlife Reserve by their mothers. As the infant matures and becomes more independent, it will stray from its mother, being carried only when the troop moves or when danger threatens. Infants often appear blue in color, as they have little fur when they are born. However, as they mature, they develop a thick fur that is brownish-grey in colour with specks of yellow and olive green. In some lighting, the fur has an overall green appearance and is why they were named \u201cgreen monkey\u201d. Photo by Mike Theiss @sandalsresorts @islandroutes #LiveFunner"

I witnessed this TV tower get struck 3 times in a 10 minute span. The third strike occurred when I was close to the tower and it was truly incredible. The lightning shot straight up from the tip of the tower and branched out like a tree up into the clouds and flashed several times before it finally discharged all its energy.

Barbados is an eastern Caribbean island located in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies, an independent British Commonwealth nation. Bridgetown, the capital, is a cruise-ship port with many historic colonial buildings. Around the island are beautiful beaches, coral reefs, shipwrecks, botanical gardens and the Harrison\u2019s Cave formation. Local traditions include afternoon tea and cricket, the national sport. We are excited to have this expedition sponsored by @SandalsResorts and look forward to a having a great time as usual.
