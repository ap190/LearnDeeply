The key is to go full couture because only the top designers can get this look right -- this is a distressed tee straight from the #Givenchy runway that you can never go wrong with. But I've paired it with a basic #Columbia short to let the blouse be the focus of the ensemble. As for accessories, I have a sturdy yet stylish belt to clip my passport on (#TravelHack!) and a bold cerulean ball cap that says \"I'm ready for some fun in the sun!\" \ud83d\ude0a My athletic footwear has me prepared for anything, and remember -- always pair a white sneaker with a classic black crew sock!

But the footwear and accessories are what really elevates this outfit. YES these are fabulous #Ferragamo loafers and I have paired them with a neon athletic sock like the risk-taking trendsetter that I am! I added my favorite #PanamaHat from #Orvis, slung on my #Hermes #ManBag, and of course, rocking my stunner shades. \ud83d\ude0e And one of my secret #StyleTips: wear a #VIP lanyard as a necklace so you always look like you're heading somewhere important. \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc #VIPlife #OOTD #StreetStyle #SpringFashion #WeekendFlow #StayWoke #FashionBlogger #MadForPlaid #AccessoriesAreEverything #FootwearOnFleek #WhoWhatWear #FashionDads via @isobelj",

First of all, short athletic shorts are a staple -- they provide comfort and mobility for everything you do, and I love to show off my shapely #YogaLegs. \ud83d\ude0a I also love to go #monochromatic these days, so I chose a chic and breathable lime green tee to match my #Nike shorts. Mark my words -- bold greens are fresh off the runway and guaranteed to be one of this season's hottest hues! \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a And this custom-designed tool belt is really adding some rugged flair to the ensemble, don't you think? \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb #OOTD #WhatIWore #WorkFlow #AllGreenEverything #DIYlife #Pinterest #BlessedToBlog #Fashion #Style #RunwayReady #FashionDads via @hdunham",

I love when you guys catch me in action. \ud83d\ude0e Today while picking up a new mobile phone at #Walmart, I chose a fairly low-key ensemble (you know I dress up for more Target, though! \ud83d\ude1c). I paired a trendy, mid-rise #Puma athletic short with a bold yellow blouse (tucked in, of course) from #TJMaxx because bright colors are so on-trend right now. For footwear, I'm donning a classic pair of #Birkenstocks, THE must-have shoe for spring and summer, and I completed the look with a chic ball cap that really ties everything together.

I am feeling so #blessed to celebrate #FathersDay in Florida in such a fabulous ensemble. \ud83d\ude0e I always like to mix in a splash of silly with my style on holidays, so today was the perfect opportunity to wear this custom t-shirt from #PacificPunwear. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udca8I paired it with a stunning but simple cargo short from #AmericanEagle and my signature #Teva sandals (had to leave the #Gucci loafers back at the hotel in this warm weather \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc). I spiced things up even more with a chic #Pok\u00e9mon ball cap and a subtle orange bracelet because accessories truly are everything.
