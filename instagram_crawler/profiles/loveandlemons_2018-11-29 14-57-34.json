For holiday entertaining, I like to keep my table decor simple so that the food stands out - neutral fabrics, plates, and mismatched silverware (because I don\u2019t actually own four forks that match). #gatherwithcolor #sponsored\n\nrecipe:\n2 tablespoons olive oil, more for drizzling\n3 shallots, thinly sliced\n1 large fennel bulb, thinly sliced\n3 garlic cloves, sliced\n\u00bc teaspoon red pepper flakes\n\u00bc cup chopped sage\n12-ounces short-cut pasta\n\u00bc cup dry white wine\n8 cups torn kale leaves\n8 oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, chopped\n\u00bc cup chopped walnuts, toasted\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\nSea salt and freshly ground black pepper\nFreshly grated pecorino cheese\n\nHeat the oil in a large braiser or skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots, fennel, garlic, red pepper flakes, sage, \u00bd teaspoon salt, and freshly ground black pepper and cook until the fennel is tender, about 8 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente.\nTo the fennel mixture, add the white wine and let it reduce for 30 seconds. Reduce the heat to low, add the kale and toss until just wilted. Use a slotted spoon to scoop the cooked pasta into the braiser/skillet. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, walnuts, lemon juice and toss.\nSeason to taste and serve with drizzles of olive oil and grated pecorino cheese.\n\nServes 4\nhttps://bit.ly/2TBZ3yU"
