Not only the scenery was jaw-dropping gorgeous, but also the wildlife we encountered were amazing. We saw Hawaiian Spinner Dolphins \ud83d\udc2c , Humpback Whales \ud83d\udc0b , Manta Rays and Sea Turtles \ud83d\udc22 (in one trip!!!). It is really a must-do experience on the island!

For anyone who knows me well, they can tell you that I am not the most confident person in the open water (a nicer way to say that I am scared of swimming in the ocean \ud83d\ude1c). I was terrified with just snorkeling (alway felt like I was going to drown). When my 11 years old son wanted to learn diving and needed a buddy, he asked me if I want to do it with him. I did not have want to discourage him from pursuing something he loves, but deep down I wasn\u2019t really sure how this would turn out. We signed up with @seasportdivers in Kauai to do the open water training and certification. Our @PADITV instructors, Liz and Josh, were the best people to learn diving from. Both of them were passionate, encouraging, supportive and funny. They made diving look so easy and helped us every step along the way to build up our confidence and skills under water. It was the most exhilarating experience to dive down to the ocean floor and swim with some amazing ocean creatures. After four super fun dives, my boy and I both got certified! We are now official @PADITV divers. We felt like a whole new world just opened to us and now we can\u2019t wait to dive more, practice more and explore more. If you ever thought about trying scuba diving, I would highly recommend you to try. It is really a lot easier than you thought and yes, way more exciting then you expected as well. If I can do it, you can definitely do it! Also, I couldn\u2019t be happier for my boy, who is now going start his diving journey at this young age. Letting the kids to try something new and challenge themselves is the best gift I believe we, as parents, can give to them. (Hint: would be a great Christmas present!!!\ud83c\udf81) #padi #kauai #hawaii"

Kauai\u2019s Mt.
