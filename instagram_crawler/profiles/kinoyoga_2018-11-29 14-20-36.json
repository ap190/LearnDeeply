Don\u2019t feel bad about yourself if it doesn\u2019t happen on the first or the first thousand tries. It\u2019s practice and all that matters is that you try. If you see a perfect picture it\u2019s often a snapshot into an imperfect reality. Struggle and understanding the reality of it are essential elements of learning in the field of yoga. So, the next time you find yourself comparing your achievements or process to someone else, remember to be kind and gentle with yourself. Instead of seeing your own failure in someone else\u2019s success look for their hard work and ceaseless dedication and let it inspire to practice more. I hope seeing my struggle here helps keep it real. I\u2019m not some alien yoga deity who did everything with little practice. I\u2019m just a girl who has been practicing for a long time. I was never a dancer, never a gymnast, never on a sports team. Whatever strength and grace you see in me is just your own potential reflected back. The magic secret is simple, just keep practicing.\n_\nAnd of course if you want to practice with me online, the best place is @omstarsofficial \ud83d\ude4f\n_\nNew student yearly promo\n$80/year, less than $7/month\nUse code BLACKFRIDAY\n_\nMembers offers\n30% entire shop\nUse code GRATITUDE\n30% off all Teacher Development Courses\nNo code required, automatic once you\u2019re logged in\n_\n40% off select Omstars by Liquido prints\nNo code, discount already applied on sale items \ud83d\ude0a"

It\u2019s been over a year now. I was told that many students were disappointed that I didn\u2019t make it last year. I hope you all know just how I sorry I am that I didn\u2019t make it.\n_\nThe last year has been an exercise in grief. After over a year, I am finally starting to feel like myself again. I have many thoughts about grief, but if I can give everyone one small piece of unsolicited advice it\u2019s this\u2014give yourself one full year after the passing of a loved one before you do anything drastic, public or potentially life-altering. You may think you\u2019re fine, but you\u2019re not. Your life changed forever the moment the person you loved died.\n_\nI have reflected much on the meaning of life, pain, love and suffering. There were moments all I could see was that I am no-thing. I am in fact not \u201cI\u201d. The notion of the self is a falsehood created from temporal experience. Neither the body, mind, possessions, accomplishments, failure, no-thing is truly who \u201cI\u201d am. Wisdom tells the freeing truth that there is no I nor mine. To live in a cage is to be defined by the sentence \u201cI am\u201d. As soon as you identify with an image of self, it defined you. Freedom lies in the vast open emptiness of selflessness.\n_\nAnd yet, love is real, and love whispers of a deep interconnectedness between all beings, all things. Love embraces all things in its infinite oneness. Love in its pure presence unfolds like a mystery, a place in time that sees without the baggage of the past or the pressure of the future, innocence itself, with all the promise of redemption and all the glory of hope. Love, yes, love is so very real. And permanent.\n_\nIn the dance between wisdom and love, selflessness and individuality, here, in the in-between space, lies the mystery known as life. Universal and personal at once. Infinitely expansive and humblingly fleeting. About one thing there is no doubt, that is, that each moment is a gift to be treasured and cherished. I have found great solace in the simple beauty and profound kindness that surrounds me in every single moment."

There is timeless eternality in every moment, but you have to pause long enough to sense it. Today, just for a few breaths I encourage you to close you eyes and tap into the profound stillness under all things.\n_\nNo matter how problematic or stressful it may seem right now, there is a depth of peace running as an undercurrent. No matter how divisive and polarized it might feel, the yearning for a kinder, more joyful world lives in every heart. No matter how stuck and hopeless it appears, there is a promise of peace that will one day overcome everything else. You can feel it, hidden in the burning embers of sunset, in the wind beneath the wings of birds, in the delicate texture of flower petals and in whispers of clouds on the lips of the earth.\n_\n#practiceyogachangeyourworld #onebreathatatime"

This feels like coming home.\n_\nBaddha Konasana A, B & C takes the spine through different positions of the spine with the hips in external rotation. Can you spot them?\n_\nIn A, the spine is as straight as possible and the sitting bones can come off the floor as you pivot forward. In B, the back is rounded and the sitting bones push into the ground. In C, the spine is lifted up out of the pelvic bowl, sitting bones are down and the chin is down. Pressing the heels and the bases of the little toes in to each other protects the knees as the inner thighs lengthen. Of course, always keep the pelvic floor and the muscles of the lower belly drawn in.\n\nThis #yogatutorial about #baddhakonasana is part of a whole new series that just launched on @omstarsofficial I\u2019ll be sharing some of them here, but if you can\u2019t wait, to watch on Omstars.com.\n_\nDo you have requests?

I\u2019m at my worst when I\u2019ve got tunnel vision and I\u2019m stressing about potential outcomes. In the heart space I\u2019m filled with wonder, often surprised by the effortlessness of things. In the struggle space I\u2019m obsessed with details and will try anything to manipulate the way things unfold.\n_\nMaybe just maybe, all our magic is with us the moment we are born. We spend years of our life learning the rules of the world. But then, to tap into our magic sometimes I think you have to be willing to trade in the rules for fun. If life is a game, I don\u2019t want to win, but I might want to change the game entirety.\n_\nImagine if everything was really exactly as it should be, all your struggles and all your loss, all your joy and all your peace. Imagine if every single thing in your life was laid out in absolute perfection, a divine orchestration for you, for your learning, for your joy and for your magic. Imagine if....\n_\nI couldn\u2019t have planned this picture. After a day of teaching I walked down to see the sunset and got inspired. I set up my tripod and popped up in a quick handstand. There was no one around, just me on the beach having fun. The universe is working in your favor, even or rather especially when you think it\u2019s not. There are periods of struggle and resistance, times when nothing makes sense. One day it will clear. Sometime in the not-to-distant future you\u2019ll look back at the hard times with a heart full of love, forgiveness and wisdom. There are lessons so deep that our minds cannot comprehend them until we live them. I\u2019ve gone through so many phases of heartbreak and loss only to have those very same obstacles bring me to new levels of love and wisdom. It wasn\u2019t easy, it took time and not everyone in my life accepted or understood what was going on. But, through it all, the place in my heart that kept me going was a childlike sense of wonder and awe at all the big and small things in life.\n_\nWe are each on a mission of immense value and meaning. Even if you don\u2019t think you matter let me tell you that you do, so much so that your value is beyond measure. \ud83d\ude4f"

We all feel defeated sometimes, like we\u2019ve lost the game of life, been beaten down by big bad powerful foes who have the upper hand. Nobody wins forever, every single time. The spiritual teaching is less about how to make a winner, then it is about how to give you the strength to get through the inevitable lows. What you do when you face insurmountable odds, when you\u2019ve given all your heart and all your soul, but still came up short, that\u2019s the magic of the practice. You learn what true strength means when everyone else has quit on you and all you have left is your faith. When you pick up the prices of a shattered dream and begin again, one more time, with no bitterness in your heart, only quiet perseverance and more wisdom.\n_\nI loved learning how to handstand because I was the weakest person in the room. I was never a gymnast or a dancer or anything athletic before yoga. I wanted to quit so many times. I got mad, frustrated, sad, anxious and jealous along the way. What I experienced on the mat was a mirror for what I experienced in my life. It still is, actually. Over years of practice, I stumbled and fell. I picked myself back up again each time and tried again. I collected faith, like grains of sand being deposited on the shore. After all the years, yes I\u2019m finally able to hold a handstand. But what is the real miracle is that my world is a more peaceful, more kind and more loving space.\n_\n#practiceyogachangeyourworld #onebreathatatime\n_\nPractice handstand with me on @omstarsofficial \ud83d\ude4f"

While I\u2019ve certainly gotten a good deal of stuff done, I\u2019ve also loafed around and wasted way too much time checking out online sales. But, today during practice I had a break through.\n_\nAfter a lazy morning where I just couldn\u2019t get out of bed, I managed to drag myself onto the mat. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but I got it done. It felt like nothing worked, lift ups were not flowing, back was stiff and I started to feel hungry. Then, it hit me, the subconscious thought that has been playing in the back of my mind the last few days (and who knows for how long?). I heard this snarky little voice say, \u201cYou\u2019re a piece of shit.\u201d I kid you not. I was surprised to hear that bc I spend so much time working on planting the seeds of peaceful loving thoughts. But there it was anyway. What happened next was interesting.\n_\nI realized a big portion of my sense of self-worth is tied to achievement and doing. Over the last few days I haven\u2019t done as much as I normally do. I\u2019ve taken naps, scrolled aimlessly through animals videos, ate too much and just kind of let things go. It felt indulgent, like a cheating vacation. I felt guilty for watching Star Trek instead of working on my new book. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t done anything the last few days. I have in fact accomplished a lot (watch my stories to see my heroic project of the day). But it wasn\u2019t my usual super productive self. Emails went unanswered, clothes sat in dirty piles, dishes in the sink.\n_\nToday during my practice I chose a new direction. Instead of believing that snarky voice or pushing her out, I just listened. This is what I heard\u2014she\u2019s afraid not to work so hard because she\u2019s constantly trying to prove her worth, she\u2019s scared no one will really love her if she just chills, she\u2019s exhausted but terrified of taking a break. Ok girl, I said, I hear you, I see you and I love you, there\u2019s something I want you to know\u2014you don\u2019t need to earn your worth by doing 1,000 things, you\u2019re good enough just as you are. You can just be there and that\u2019s enough.\n_\nIt was like a big weight lifted. I felt freer, happier and lighter. Then, I went on to take two more naps."
