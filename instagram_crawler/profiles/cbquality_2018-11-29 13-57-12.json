Sure, there's something off with excess but this holiday allows many people to get the things they actually need at more reasonable prices. Maybe period care or home products or even tools aren't as sexy but it's a privilege to never have to look for a sale. Take this @intimina menstrual cup for example, it's been a favorite for a more sustainable and easy period for me and saves money in the long term. I've put the link in my bio for this @intimina cup. I'm always happy to #partner with brands that make life better for women."
