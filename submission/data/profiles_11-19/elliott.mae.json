Life goes on peeps, have your cry, eat your choc and get on with it. 👊",

Whether it be a walk, run, gym session or HIIT from my living room. I've had a slack couple of weeks (no excuses, I've been SLACK) so this week I'm setting myself a 7 day exercise goal.\nIt's never about HAVING the time. When you want something bad enough you'll make it happen. So this week, I'm making the time 👊 Who wants to jump on this with me for the week?? Comment below and tag a friend to join in. 🙋✔️",

JUST DO IT. If you don't, don't! No biggie. But don't feel bad about enjoying yourself and ALSO don't be that person that judges the people who do enjoy themselves. \nEach to their own.\nOne weekend will not completely take you off track of your goals, unless you let it drag on. Indulge, enjoy, live your life, but don't let it spiral out of control. So eat that choc and then after the long weekend you swing your butt into routine and get back on that grind sista ✊️x",

I've started making my own granola to control how much added sugar I'm having everyday. So here's how I make it:\n- Mix a couple of cups of whole grain rolled oats with some raw almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, a small amount of raisins/currants and cinnamon.\n- Melt some coconut oil, mix through. - Squeeze some natural honey or rice malt, mix through. \nSpread out on a baking tray and bake for about 10 mins, until golden. 😊👌",
