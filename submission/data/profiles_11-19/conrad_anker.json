      "description": "Flashback to that one day in 1998 when Anselme Baud and I skied the Western Ice Stream on the Vinson Massif in Antarctica. 🏔⛷❄️ Anselme is legend for his ski descents in the Mont Blanc Range. If jump turns on steep terrain in flannel shirts is your gig, check out the video (in link) of Anselme and Patrick Vallençant skiing the Arête de Peuterey back in the day.  Nice video. 👀\n\nWe were both guiding the the high point of the frozen continent and were waiting for the flight out. A thick ground fog had us grounded. Sensing the sky was clear above, we set out for a day of skiing. The main Ice Stream was calling. The ski descent was 2000 meters elevation change at a steady angle. For Anselme this was his birthday gift;  he turned 50 while on the Ice. It was, by his estimation, the longest continuous descent he had the joy of skiing. On a personal level, I was able to play with a \"ski extrem\" hero and explore the range. Anselme is a kind and generous soul. The day we skied will always be close to my heart. Thanks Anselme. #neverstopexploring @thenorthface",

Built a mini bee stand out of gneiss and stained the cedar box with tung oil. Our queen, workers and drones are on order from an apiary near Cedar City, Utah. Once the plants start blooming and the timing is right we will start the hive. 🌻🌼🌻 Our little pollinators are facing a tough go. Loss of habitat, climate change, insecticides and disease are all making bee survival a matter of global importance. One-third of of the food we consume has a connection to bees. Our goal is to help out plants in a 5 mile - 8 kilometer radius and nurture a batch of bees. Knowing that 40% of hives fail we are not taking this for granted. Challenges are good for the human spirit. 🌎🌍🌏 If you have dandelions in your yard please let them flourish. Bees benefit from these colorful plants. 🐝🐝🐝 Stay tuned for my bee line. 🤓",

      "description": "Yeah for women! On occasion of International Women's Day special thanks to these two moms. Raising children is at the core of their being. For Jenni, my spouse, thanks for raising three boys with a sense of purpose & dignity and caring for me with love. For Helga, my mother, thanks for encouraging me to find my calling and helping me realize my dreams. Both of you get extra ❤️💗❤️💕 & 🌹🌷🌸🌺 for understanding this game with gravity I play. That you both love crime solving TV shows with female protagonists and talk to the dogs in your own special dog voice is ever warming. Love you both!\n@jenniloweanker #momsarethebest",
