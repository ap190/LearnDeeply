      "description": "Confluence, Canyonlands Utah. \nI've photographed the confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers in Canyonlands National Park a lot in my career. Funny thing is that the best image I've ever made of it was with a smartphone. When I made this smartphone picture I realized that much in photography had changed. Good pictures were no longer going to be the exclusive domain of high-end cameras and professional photographers. Smartphones had come of age. They democratized photography! A photographer still has to know where and when to point the camera but the camera itself was no longer a huge factor. In the intervening years telephone cameras have only gotten better.\n\nI'd like to know what people think about the smartphone's influence on photography. Opinions??? #utah #canyonlands #smartphone",
