For more information go to the link on my IG Profile. Please share and submit!! UGANDA: This is Betty Nanozi who has been fighting for her land for over a decade simply because her husband died. Many widows in Uganda are marginalized and threatened. They can be forced out of their homes, robbed of everything they own, made to marry a brother-in-law, physically attacked or harmed—even their children can be taken away from them. A grant from the @pulitzercenter helped fund this project. Visit @ijm / International Justice Misison to Learn more about the issue of widows in Uganda and how you can help.",
