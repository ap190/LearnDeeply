      "description": "As you may already know, President Trump signed an executive order yesterday calling for a review of national monuments, saying that national monument designations \"create barriers to achieving energy independence.. and otherwise curtail economic growth.\" Perhaps what's being ignored here is that the outdoor industry provides the US economy with $887 billion in consumer spending annually and also provides 7.6 million Americans with jobs. This poses a very real threat to lands that have been preserved for future generations as well as posing a threat to the livelihood of many. If you'd like to help to defend America's public lands, voice your concerns to Secretary Zinke at 202.208.6416.",

      "description": "There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. Or rather, taking shortcuts can cheapen an experience that would otherwise have the potential to be remarkable if earned. Imagine the difference between visiting the summit of a tall mountain via a gondola vs. visiting the summit after an entire day of grueling effort. Which one would be more appreciated/memorable? Or in the case of this photo, experiencing the worlds largest natural bridge after several days of arranging logistics in a foreign country, getting giardia along the way, and rafting a remote canyon for a few days with portages and whitewater to navigate. It is possible to visit this place in a single day, but I know it would never have been so magical and appreciated without the persistence and dedication it took to complete the entire journey. In the age of instant gratification, we are always looking for the quickest way to do anything, but it's taking those shortcuts that steal gratification in the end.\nPC: @moonmountainman",

In fact, the only reason I said yes was because I had a back injury preventing me from skiing, so I figured it would be an alright way to pass the time while I healed up. Now that the trip is over and I'm back in the States, I can only shake my head at my original thought process. The places that river took us were amongst the most beautiful and remote places I've ever been in my life. Travertine waterfalls, lush jungles, parrot-filled caves, awesome rapids - the list goes on... So yeah, lesson learned - No matter how much you think you've seen, don't underestimate the ability of the natural world to inspire! üåé‚úåüèº\nPC: @backcountry13",
