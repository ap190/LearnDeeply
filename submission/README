Most of everything that is needed for the proposed multi-modal model from
our paper can be found in the 'deeply_learned' directory. This include the
final data file(s) including the associated images, as well as the dictionary
of hashtag weights and the wordnetID mappings.

The main portion of the code is within 'deeply_learned/' directory, and 
can be run with the following command:
	python main.py
A few optional arguments can be added to run specific model combinations
if so desired. The proposed multi-modal approach as described in our
paper is run by the simple command with no optional arguments.

Our data cleaner and such can be found in the directory 'data/', along with 
the data cleaning/pre-processing scripts and intermediate steps. However, 
the final data file that we used for the project is found within the 
'deeply_learned/' directory as well. Our attempt with binning and histogram 
creation can also be found in the 'data/' directory.
