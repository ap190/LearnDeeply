There are no roads on the playa\u2026 No roads and no rules. So, I drove\u2026 Fast\u2026 With loud music playing and wind beating on my face. It was perfect and, for a brief moment, all of my problems melted away into the blur of the passing desert.\" The artist captions the image with this passage: \"Sometimes it\u2019s hard to remember that life is in front of you, even when you\u2019re speeding away from the past.\" More at @le_yone. // #contemporaryphotography #artphotography #wanderlust #documentingspace #cinematicphotography #beautifuldestinations #traveldeeper #landscapephotography #mindtheminimal #landscapelovers #ig_minimalistic #landscapes #landscape_specialist #minimalmood #landscapecaptures #landscape_lovers #travelmemories #travelgram #minimalphotography #minimalism #naturegram #ontheroadagain #naturalworld #travelphotography #ontheroad #americanroads #americanlandscape #great_captures_minimal #americanroadtrip #minimallandscape",

The gathering you can see from the window is the beggining of annual Independence March. For this occasion, I booked the room to stage this photo. A week earlier, I checked view from every floor in the hotel, and finally I decided on the 9th floor, room 919. The idea was to contrast the cosy interior with the vivid, loud and sometimes violent celebration. I asked the calmest person I know to pose for this photo, and suggested she to wear the most comfortable clothes. We entered the room, rearranged it so the bed was next to the window, and just waited there for Warsaw to dissapear in flares. I took two exposures from the room and put them into one photo.\" While she prefers not to comment politically, the viral photograph has been read by some as a reflection of current unease in Europe.

Looking again at this photograph from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, I began to see what she saw \u2014 that the image strikes a different note. Although inhabited by those deep shadows that characterize much of my Mexico work, this particular photograph is quieter, more lyrical. It\u2019s as if its human moments \u2014 the couple embracing, the father holding his child \u2014 somehow manage to keep the darkness at bay, even if only briefly. Photographers don\u2019t just find photographs; sometimes photographs find photographers. In retrospect, it hardly seems surprising that this photograph found me when it did \u2014 as I was falling for the remarkable woman and lyrical photographer who\u2019s the love of my life. Three years later, we printed this photograph on our wedding invitations.\" This image is part of 'Slant Rhymes', a book of photography and poetry by Webb and Norris Webb.

Some way downstream of my tent there appeared two guys across the river holding some sheep. The nomad, named Billgunne, began one of several trips across to fetch the livestock one-by-one. My friend and I held the animals down in-between his lengths. Billgunne later told us that this particular sheep was getting old and had been selected for slaughter in the coming days.
