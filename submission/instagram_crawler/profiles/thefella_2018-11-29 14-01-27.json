Sadly, the name and addresses in this town were in Cyrillic, so even in the city I needed my trusty 3 word address to find it! I asked them hotel for a room that faced the mountains, and that night a thunderstorm rolled in and I couldn\u2019t see a thing. The next morning, however, the storm was clearing, the sun forcing its way out, and the mountains majestically peeking through the clouds. For some reason I didn\u2019t expect to see this type of landscape in Mongolia, but I was very happy when it appeared!

As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, the Lonely Planet guides (online and print) help you discover cool places to visit. Due to Mongolia being so sparse and having no real roads or addresses, what3words allows me to locate these places, because Lonely Planet now has 3 word addresses for most of their Mongolia listings. This makes me so happy! Stay tuned or some more photos from Mongolia this week, plus my Lonely Planet takeover at the weekend.\n____\n@lonelyplanet @what3words #lonelyplanet #what3words #lpPathfinders"

Sadly, most nights had torrential thunderstorms. Thankfully this night, the skies remained clear and the stars came out to play. If you recall the man on the camel in my other photo, his name is Baasanhuu and he owns this ger camp. Without the 3 word address in the guide book, I really would have struggled to find this camp. Why not find \u201cbeanbag.skier.pigments\u201d for yourself and see how remote this camp is!\n____\n@lonelyplanet @what3words #lonelyplanet #what3words #lpPathfinders"

Slieve Bearnagh looks like an exploded volcano from this angle. If anyone wants any photography lessons or workshops in N.I., let me know!\nI\u2019ve also had a busy time with conferences. I was recently speaking and teaching in Jersey in partnership with @visitjerseyci, @think_tourism, and @whalar(alongside my friends @rontimehin, @cinepix, @jorgo_k, @shisodelicious, and others). Then I was back home for #STSBelfast with @discoverni, @tourismireland, @lovegreatbritain, and many more friends. (I also appeared on @brendanvanson's podcast). Phew. Just letting everyone in socialmedialand know that I'm still alive!\n____\n#discoverearth #discoverer #passionpassport\n#beautifuldestinations #guardiantravelsnaps #resourcetravel #mytinyatlas"

They from all over the world, including some Muslims from the UK, Indonesia and Texas, plus my good Sikh friend @harjinderkukreja and his family. Plus yours truly, a white Irish atheist \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. This photo is of \u015eerefiye Sarn\u0131c\u0131, a cistern that was used to store huge amounts of water underground. Thanks to @gitasav for being patient and modelling for me.
