I was able to shoot a beetle collection that belonged to Alfred Russel Wallace. I was able to shoot this collection for \u201cThe Man who Wasn\u2019t Darwin\u201d for @natgeo.\nWallace along with Darwin conceived of #NaturalSelection to be the vehicle that propelled evolution forward. Wallace wrote Darwin a letter in 1858 proposing the idea, an idea which Darwin had been restlessly trying to prove to himself ever since he set foot back in England from his five-year voyage on the Beagle.\n\nThe collection was found in a Wallace ancestral home and lovingly repaired by @GeorgeBeccaloni of the #BritishMuseum."

As with other port cities of its day, Ashkelon bosted a very diverse population mixing local peoples with foreign merchants which helped the city become an exchange point for customs, languages, and ideas. Most of all, in the words of one text, \"Ashkelon was a town likable to the heart, with firm walls and mightly structures, which people liked to inhabit.\" The city at one time or another was ruled by Ancient Egyptians, the Canaanites, the Philistines, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Hasmoneans, the Romans, the Persians, the Arabs, and the Crusaders until it was destroyed by the Mamluks in 1270 CE. The archaeologist found, which makes perfect sense, that the deeper you dig the older the artifacts get.\n@Drtracyhoffman was the contact that we had and who made the story much better by helping me out. @atedge"

Anyone who knows and loves photography will start running through his images in their mind, never quite being able to choose a favorite one. Take a look at his feed and take part in his sale, buying a picture from a true American color photography masters.\nAmish Boy with Guinea Pig\nAs part of my bi-annual flash sale, I have decided to offer this signed 6\u201d x 9\u201d image on a 9\u201d x 11\u201d paper at $100 for a three week period beginning October 8th and ending on October 28th at 11:59 pm (EST).\nLancaster County, Pennsylvania 1964\nThis gentle portrait of an Amish boy holding his pet guinea pig started my career as a professional photographer and my 50 years as a contributor to National Geographic Magazine.\nIn the spring of 1964, I was blessed with getting a photographic internship at National Geographic in Washington D.C. after showing my portfolio of work to Robert E. Gilka, the legendary director of photography at National Geographic. As my first assignment as an intern, Gilka sent me to Lancaster County, PA to cover a Pennsylvania Dutch festival. \"Try to get some pictures of the Amish, if you can,\" he told me. It seemed the magazine had a finished manuscript about the Amish but had no pictures. He didn't tell he'd earlier sent a staff photographer to Pennsylvania who'd come back with nothing. Although I photographed the festival events my success with the Amish came through driving the country roads, introducing myself to Amish farmers, many of whom turned me down but eventually finding one who allowed me to photograph his family and their way of life. My first assignment which was to have been for a weekend or perhaps a week, lasted through much of the summer and into the fall of 1964. On an overcast afternoon, after photographing an Amish farmer working in his fields I was brought to the barn by his son so he could show me his pet guinea pig. My portrait of the boy and his pet became the lead picture in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster county published in the August, 1965 issue, a story which has been credited as the beginning of a new, more intimate look at people in the National Geographic Magazine."

Al-Khazneh (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0632\u0646\u0629; \"The Treasury\") is one of the most elaborate temples in the ancient Arab Nabatean Kingdom city of Petra. As with most of the other buildings in this ancient town, including the Monastery (Arabic: Ad Deir), this structure was carved out of a sandstone rock face.\nThe structure is believed to have been the mausoleum of the Nabatean King Aretas IV in the 1st century AD. It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in both Jordan and the region. It became to be known as \"Al-Khazneh\", or The Treasury, in the early 19th century by the area's Bedouins as they had believed it contained treasures."

This is pre-digital for me, and I was using type 55 #Polaroid so that I could have a beautiful creamy negative to make a print from. This was dot on my 4x5 #Sinar in 2008. By the way Darwin was not wrong."

Photographing the Amish was the beginning of my photographic depiction of several subcultures in my country and elsewhere during the 1960's. My essays on the Amish in 1964, the Basques of France and Spain in 1968, and the Hutterites of Montana in 1969, all dealt with the lives of people living in a culture all their own.\nThis flash sale print is an archival ink jet print on archival watercolor paper. It is signed in graphite pencil on the front border and on the back and is a perfect gift for a young aspiring photographer or for anyone who loves photography. All prints are shipped via USPS priority mail."

Because of how fragile both moth's and butterflies are, they don't show up very often in the fossil record. Not until recently have scientist agree upon when they appeared. They have settled on the Jurassic period, give or take a few million years.\nThe above is a swallowtail moth from Cambodia, #LyssaZampa, they are also found in China and #Singapore and #Borneo."

The almost impossible job to edit the amazing pictures in the magazine falls to @roseleen the director of Photography for @NatGeo. You can see the entire edit by following the link in my bio. Paralympian sprinter @wallace_jarryd Wallace\u2019s mechanics are analyzed at the Southern Methodist University Locomotor Performance Laboratory in Dallas, Texas. \u201cThere was a lot I was doing wrong,\u201d says Wallace, 28. The four\u00ad-time world record holder, whose lower right leg had to be amputated because of a muscle disorder, uses the lab\u2019s analysis of his stride to run even faster."

The temple complex in #Cambodia and one of the largest religious monuments in the world is on a site measuring 402 acres.\nIt was originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire, gradually transforming into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the 12th century. It was built by the King Suryavarman II.\n\nThe control of water and heavy rains which repeatedly flooded the complex and lead to the capital of the empire to be moved to Phnom Pen. Those rains and the age of seafaring exploration where the two main reason for the \"abandonment\" of #AngkorWat. @atedge @natgeo @thephotosociety"
