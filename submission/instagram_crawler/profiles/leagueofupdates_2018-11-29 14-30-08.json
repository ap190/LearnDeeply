Hitting multiple champions with an ability grants multiple stacks, and basic attacking extends their duration. Each stack adds bonus magic damage to her basic attacks. At max stacks, this bonus damage is increased against shields, and Irelia also gains attack speed.\n\u2022 Q BLADESURGE Irelia dashes to a target, dealing physical damage (increased if it\u2019s a minion or monster), applying on-hit effects, and healing for a small amount. If the target was marked or dies to Bladesurge, its cooldown is refreshed.\n\u2022 W DEFIANT DANCE First Cast: Irelia begins charging her blades, losing the ability to move or attack but gaining significant damage reduction for a brief period. This channel can\u2019t be interrupted. Second Cast: Irelia lashes out with her blades, dealing physical damage in a line. The damage increases as Irelia charges.\n\u2022 E FLAWLESS DUET Irelia sends a blade to a location, and can recast Flawless Duet to send a second blade to another location. The blades will then fly towards one another, dealing magic damage and stunning enemies caught in the crossfire. Flawless Duet also marks champions and large monsters for a few seconds.\n\u2022 R VANGUARD'S EDGE Irelia unleashes the full force of her blades in a line. If Vanguard's Edge hits an enemy champion, the blades will radiate outward, dealing damage and marking enemy champions and large monsters, and forming a barrier that lasts for a few seconds. This blade wall deals magic damage and significantly slows enemy champions that pass through it. It also disarms them for a few seconds, making them unable to basic attack.\n\n#leagueoflegends #irelia",

When we started Irelia\u2019s rework, our main goal was to transform her into the master of levitating blades that her theme implies\u2014she should be surging into the thick of battle, where she can pierce the shields of her enemies before cutting them down in a flurry of dancing blades.\nLike I mentioned before, we\u2019re keeping her current Q, Bladesurge, as we believe it\u2019s a great ability that\u2019s core to Irelia, and we\u2019ll even be spicing it up by giving her more reset opportunities.  The rest of her kit is going through pretty big changes to help fully realize her theme. We still want to maintain her strength against ranged champions and want her to be able to fight at a relatively long range (for a fighter), poking at her enemies with a thousand tiny cuts before surging in for the kill.\n\nAs a war heroine, Irelia also needs some tools to initiate a fight and signal to her teammates that negotiations have failed and it\u2019s time to fight back. Get ready to surge into battle with Irelia later this year.",

But before we get to the specifics, let\u2019s take a step back and look more broadly at our plans for the future.\n\nON NEW AND OLD CHAMPIONS\nLast year, we decided to combine the Champion Update Team and the New Champions Team into one big squad. One of the major reasons we combined forces was so that we\u2019d have more flexibility in our release schedule and be able to better adapt to the needs of players and League over time. As the game has evolved, more and more champions have become outdated and in need of large-scale reworks. At the same time, with 140 champions in the game, the pressure on new champions to give players new and exciting ways to play League has grown massively. Be it with Kayn\u2019s permanent transformation, Zoe\u2019s ability to steal summoners spells, or Xayah and Rakan\u2019s unique synergy, our most successful champions have been the ones that let players experience things they have never done before in League.\nThe bar is high for new champs, and moving forward, every new champion will offer unique ways to play. As such, we will be slightly ramping down the amount of new champions we release in order to make sure every release is breaking the boundaries of the game. That said, we know it\u2019s important to keep League modern and fresh, so we\u2019ll be ramping up our VGU releases, which will also allow us to catch up on the amount of champions currently feeling neglected or outdated. We are pretty excited about this shift, but please let me know what you think in the comments below.\nNEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON THE SEA\nLet\u2019s reset a bit and wade right into the next champion we\u2019re adding to the list. We felt it was time to execute on a new support with a darker, deeper thematic than most of our support cast. We also wanted to create an aggressive playmaker, someone who doesn\u2019t just save a drowning ally, but who forces their enemies to drown themselves\u2026 by their own hands.\nKeep your health high, your eyes to the sea, and pray you aren\u2019t on the list. ... more in comments.",

We've changed our patch cycle to alternate between larger game updates and shorter balance tweaks. This is probably our first true \"big patch,\" so it's structured differently than normal.\nFirst, we're looking into mage itemization, and there's been a minor overhaul on those items. Mages often have fixed build paths, so we wanted to give them new items\u2014and revamp the old ones\u2014to create more choice overall.\nAfter that, let's go top lane. We've seen a few top laners make the laning phase too consistent with sustain or base damage: Most champions can't fight them, and they can just avoid the ones who can. We want to make a more variant top lane, so we're addressing those outliers and working to make a more satisfying experience overall.\nFinally, we're pushing some big changes to a few champions we think require the gameplay changes. There's Zoe, Rengar, and Volibear, plus some smaller changes mixed in.\nDig into the patch notes now so you're prepared to hop onto the Rift when the patch hits live!\n\n#leagueoflegends",

New software built by our tools team requires champions to be updated in your game install, and an audio engine update requires a re-patch of audio data. These updates will allow us to create even better in-game content and audio moving forward.\n\nHi everyone, Riot Eno and Riot Searsha from the Audio and Content Efficiency teams here to talk about a few upcoming patches. Our teams work on the tools and tech that enable Rioters to deliver awesome content to players. In order to level up those tools, we need to lay some groundwork that requires data changes behind the scenes. These updates will make patches 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, and potentially 8.10 larger than usual, so we wanted to give you a heads up and provide some background information as to why.\nTwo projects are happening simultaneously\u2014Audio will be upgrading to a new audio engine in patch 8.5, and Content Efficiency will be moving champions into a new tools ecosystem in patches 8.6 to 8.8 and potentially 8.10.",

His gameplay is undergoing a less drastic transformation than past updates, but you'll look a heck of a lot better while slinging skillshots and nabbing bounties\u2014and you still won't need a map.*\n*Please always pay attention to your minimap.\nOther than that, this one's a pretty quiet patch as we switch gears behind the scenes from Worlds balancing toward preseason preparations. We're mainly tuning a few things to be a little less lethal in the early/mid-game, other than Nami or Sion who should ideally die at least sometimes (up from never).\nThat's it!

Over time, waveclear champions have slowly edged out all other champions in mid lane, to the detriment of overall playstyle diversity. Basically, it's become too easy to spam your spells on waves, and the items which give you the mana to do so are also just the best choices. We're updating the core mana items mages buy, the base mana/mana regen of mages, and more.\nOn top of that, we're looking at game pacing over the next few patches. We want to make sure that there are fewer games that feel like they're lost but just won't end for awhile. The first step is looking at objectives. First, we're making Baron more accessible when you're ahead, but also more contestable in closer games. We're also upping the strength of Rift Herald when teams are able to safely shepherd it, but also increasing the ability of opposing teams to kill it when they see an opening.\nFinally, we're reworking Unsealed Spellbook. The old model mostly meant \"you get to flash more,\" and we're trying to create a keystone that really sells the fantasy of getting to play around with the whole spellbook, not just two summoner spells.\nSo get out there and clear some waves (not many), bash Rift Herald into some towers, and swap some summoner spells. #leagueoflegends",

As we move towards the middle of the season, the next few months will be jam-packed with a bunch of events (MSI, the launch of Clash, and start of the summer split to name a few). This puts a lot of pressure on specific patches, so \"big patch, small patch\" is gonna look like \"medium patch, medium patch\" for a little while.\nThat being said, there are some pretty big changes this patch! First, we're taking a look at a duo of champions who we've struggled to handle. As we tried to make LeBlanc and Ahri less frustrating to play against, we ended up shifting them too far away from being assassins; instead shaping them into mages that kite opponents with mobility and crowd control. This patch, we're trying to push them back into an assassin playstyle, while keeping some of the fairness gains of their prior updates. We'll have to keep an eye on them in the coming patches, but in general they should excel at bursting priority targets and snowballing that lead into a win.\nGLHF, and we'll see you on the Rift!\nPosted by @king2dom\n___\n#leagueoflegends #patches",

Looking back at the last few marksmen released, we discovered something that\u2019s been null from our roster for a long time: a super high-risk, high-reward marksman, in the vein of well\u2026 Vayne. With that in mind, we locked onto a marksman that rewards players who aren\u2019t afraid to hunt for the perfect opportunity, no matter where it takes them. This new champion\u2019s best players will go deep into enemy territory and thrive, while the weak players will perish, never to be heard from again.",
