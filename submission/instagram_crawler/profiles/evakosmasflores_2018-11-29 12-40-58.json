It could be the color of an heirloom tomato, the satisfying *crunch* of the top of a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, or the sweet and herbal flavor of caramelized fennel\u2014I try to be ready whenever inspiration strikes. For this delicious chocolate and coffee mousse, I drew inspiration from the spiced notes + silkiness of @nespresso's new #MasterOrigin Mexico coffee.\n.\nFor me, craftsmanship and creativity go hand in hand. Craftsmanship means doing more than just creating, it's doing your best to create the highest quality result with the utmost care and respect for the art of the craft, and every person + object involved. \ud83c\udfa8\n.\nAs a creative and a storyteller I have a lot of respect for those who are passionate about what they do and take the time to perfect their craft. An exemplary example of this is @nespresso, and their new #MasterOrigin line of coffees readily speaks to this. Their Mexico #MasterOrigin coffee involves blending both medium-roasted Arabica and deeply-roasted Robusta beans. Like grape varietals with winemaking, blending different varieties of coffee beans is an art that creates incredible flavor variations.\n.\nThe Robusta variety has a particularly sticky fruit, and requires a delicate double wash and soak to clean the beans completely, which is why it's a rare variety that isn't used as often due to the extra care it requires to get the best possible flavor from every single bean. This kind of attention to detail shows the love and dedication to perfection that goes into every cup of @nespresso, and you can taste the difference in each sip. I highly recommend giving this *incredibly* flavorful and delicious new coffee a try! If you need me, I'll be alternating between sipping @nespresso and enjoying this mousse \ud83d\ude06 #NespressoTastemakers\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#coffeeculture #coffeeoftheday #coffeesesh #cupsinframe #howiseemycoffee #igcoffee #instacoffee"

During the holidays I always #ShopSmall with @AmericanExpress, and gifting plants from this beautiful local store is one of my favorite ways to share the love and support small businesses. #ad\n.\nGrowing up in my parents' Greek deli taught me the importance of small business within a community, and how it can bring people together and offer them services and a level of local understanding that big chain stores and online giants just don't have. It also ingrained in me how much these small businesses care for their customers, and how incredibly hard they work to be there for the community.\n.\nSo this small business Saturday, come together and shop small in your own city. Your town, your community, and your gift recipients will thank you! #amexambassador\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#instagardeners #gardenlove #gardendesign #gardeninspiration #inmygarden #tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rd #jardin #hage #giardino #outdoorliving #outdoorlife #instagarden #loves_garden #instagardenlovers #Forageandharvest #botanical #growsomethinggreen #growyourownfood #garden_explorers #garden_styles #folkscenery #forageandharvest #foragedbouquet #floweroftheday #flashesofdelight #pursuepretty"

In many cultures, it's also thought that this is the time when the connection between the world of the living and the world of those we've lost is strongest, hence the 'spooky' elements of the holiday. \ud83d\udd2e\n.\nRegardless of what you believe, I hope you all enjoyed these last few days of October and soak up as much of the autumn harvest as you can. I'm talking pumpkin soup, apple cider, pecan bars, and all that tasty stuff! \ud83c\udf4f\n.\nIf you are celebrating Halloween, I wish you a wonderful holiday filled with tasty treats, some not-too-scary tricks, and adorable trick-or-treaters at your door. And if you haven't gotten your candy yet, consider this your friendly reminder. Nobody likes the grumpy old neighbor who leaves their lights off with no bowl of candy on their doorstep! \ud83d\udc7b\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#autumncolors #autumnvibes #autumnishere #helloautumn #loveautumn #myfavouriteseason #iloveautumn #cntraveler #traveltheworld #bbctravel #igtravel #letsgoeverywhere #tlpicks #passportready #travelblogger #gaurdiantravelsnaps #beautifuldestinations #wanderlust #openmyworld #lifewelltravelled #dametraveler #travelbug #wanderfolk #theoutbound #stayandwander #exploretocreate #aquietstyle #gritandvirtue #roamtheplanet #tasteintravel"

All your feedback about what you'd like to learn about was so incredibly helpful, and I've structured it to hit on all those notes! \u2b50\ufe0f\n.\nBeing a part of the creative community for a decade has shown me how important collaboration is, and how helpful it is to get outside opinions and advice. I am *so* excited to create a space where women in the creative field can be honest about what their struggling with, lift each other up with advice and insight, and achieve big goals in 2019.\n.\nIf you've attended one of my workshops or my online courses, you know how much I love teaching (\ud83e\udd13), so that will be incorporated into it, too! Plus a couple in-person workshops just for the mastermind group. It's going to be really, really incredible to work with the same group of women all year. \u2728\n.\nIf this sounds like your jam, you can sign up to be notified via the link in profile when registration opens. \u261d\ud83c\udffc I'd love for you to send me a message, too, letting me know that you're interested! \u270d\ud83c\udffc\n.\nWishing you all a wonderful rest of your Wednesday!!! \ud83e\udde1\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#firstweeat #eattheworld #heresmyfood #foodandwine #foodiegram #farmfresh #eatpretty #buzzfeedfood #todayfood #farmtofork #recipeoftheday #forkfeed #tastingtable #seriouseats #foodoftheday #insiderfood #lovecooking #homemadefood #lifeandthyme #seasonalfood #feedfeed #foooodieee #drooolclub #food4thought #foodadventure #foodieblog #foragebyfolk #instafood #eatmunchies #fromscratch"

If you're looking for a good turkey recipe, I highly recommend the pear-glazed turkey in the recipe archives at Adventuresincooking.com \ud83c\udf57\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude0b\n.\nIt's the only recipe I make whenever I prepare a turkey, and I always get rave reviews on how juicy and flavorful it is. The recipe on the blog provides you with the turkey, stuffing, a glaze, and pan-drippin' gravy so you'll end up with quite the spread! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\n.\nI also highly recommend bringing your bird, which I detail in the recipe. Brining the bird deposits salt crystals in the bird, and salt soaks up and holds onto moisture (like when you sprinkle salt on raw veggies to draw the moisture out). The salt crystals that remain in the bird after brining hold onto moisture and keep it in the bird as it's cooking. Salt also helps break down protein, so it also tenderizes the bird, which is especially helpful in parts like the breast which can get a little gamey if over-cooked.\n.\nI hope this info helps ecourage you to give brining a try, I can't recommend it highly enough!! \ud83e\udd83\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#foodandwine #foodiegram #farmfresh #eatpretty #farmtofork #recipeoftheday #forkfeed #seriouseats #foodoftheday #insiderfood #lovecooking #homemadefood #lifeandthyme #foooodieee #drooolclub #food4thought #foodadventure #foodieblog #foragebyfolk #thanksgivingdinner #thanksgivingfeast #thanksgivingdecor #thanksgiving\ud83e\udd83 #holidaydecor #turkeytime #thanksgivingprep #happythanksgiving #happythanksgivingyall #\ud83e\udd83 #gobble"

A couple months ago I was grappling with a period of staleness, where I was having an incredibly difficult time creating. I was bored with my own style and work, and felt uninspired in general.\n.\nThe idea of thinking something to cook and style and shoot and write about seemed simultaneously overwhelming and uninteresting. I was having a \"meh\" moment about my creative work as a whole.\n.\nThis happens to even the best of us\u2014every creative I know struggles with getting stuck in their comfort zone, which eventually leads to boredom and a lack of inspiration overall. The good thing is that those types of feelings comes in waves, and while sometimes the wave can seem like an insurmountable 150 foot tall one, like all waves it too will pass.\n.\nThis Saturday morning I'm sending out an email talking more in depth about this struggle, and the ways I learned to overcome creative stagnation. You can sign up for my mailing list via the link in profile to learn more about breaking out of your creative comfort zone \u261d\ud83c\udffc\n.\nIt's so important to address these struggles that we all have and share\u2014no one is inspired and creating magic 24/7, and learning to cope with those periods of frustration and lack of motivation is a key part of being a functioning creative. I hope this helps y'all and let's you know that you're not alone in your creative strife! \ud83d\udc9a\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#seekthesimplicity #darlingdaily #mycanonstory #flashesofdelight #pursuepretty #petitejoys #morningslikethese #thedulcetlife #foundforaged #livefolk #pnwcollectives #creativityfound #darlingweekend #darlingmovement #thatsdarling #thepeoplescreatives\n#lifeofadventure #searchwandercollect #bldg25 #mystillsunday #thatauthenticfeeling #littlestoriesofmylife #thehappynow #autumncolors #autumnvibes #autumnishere #helloautumn #loveautumn #myfavouriteseason #iloveautumn"

It's a long, narrow building with two stories of bookshelves on either side, and dark wood paneling as far as the eye can see. Every shelf is heavy with old books, full of stories, histories, and adventures.\n.\nLibraries are my favorite buildings, there's just something magical + enchanting about them. All that potential tucked away in each page. Knowledge, inspiration, entertainment...books can change your whole world and you don't even have to leave the room.\n.\nAs a little girl, I read obsessively. My mom could always tell if I was reading past my bedtime by the light coming through under my bedroom door, so I'd turn off my light when I knew she was going to bed, wait until I heard her walk to my parents bedroom, and then turn my light back on again and read until I fell asleep with a book on my chest.\n.\nIn college, I worked all four years at the campus library. I loved being on the hidden \"other\" side of it where all the books were sorted and organized as the new shipments of texts came in. The smell of freshly printed pages was almost as wonderful as the friendly musty smell of the old ones.\n.\nAs an adult, I read much, *much* less than I did as a kid, and that's a real bummer. I've set a goal for myself to read 1 book a month starting this winter, and I'm open to suggestions! I tend to love fiction thrillers + mysteries, and non-fiction books about plants, animals, and history, but am pretty open to anything. I'm all ears, friends!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#librarylife #finditstyleit #smallspacesquad #diywin #homerenovation #interiordesign #modernhome #cottagestyle #oldhouselove #interior123 #librarydesign #library #bookshelf #mycanonstory #cntraveler #huffposttravel #lonelyplanet\n#passionpassport #traveldeeper #mycanonstory #traveltheworld #bbctravel #igtravel #letsgoeverywhere #booklovers #passportready #gaurdiantravelsnaps #beautifuldestinations #wanderlust #openmyworld"

There's just something unspeakably beautiful about seeing all the trees' leaves change colors to the most vibrant yellow and orange hues. Walking through the woods the past few weeks has been incredible\u2014being bombarded with neon gold and ochre and crimson from all sides leaves me a little breathless and truly in awe of the natural world. \ud83c\udf41\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udf42\n.\nAs the trees take their time to go dormant during the winter season, I think it's important that we all take a cue from them and give ourselves a little break. Allow yourself to relax a little more. Give yourself time away from tv and electronics and tons of social outings. Let yourself be bored.\n.\nYou get some amazing thoughts + ideas when you're bored, but in this era of constant stimulation the human mind doesn't get to wander as often, and that's a shame. Part of why I love hiking + wandering outside so much is that it gives me a chance to focus on something physical, the natural world around me, and allows my mind to just relax and enjoy the moment. And sometimes I end up with pretty good ideas after the walk, too! \ud83e\udd13\n.\nIf you have a moment, I highly recommend giving yourself a little 'boredom' time this week. Whether that means sitting inside with a hot cup of tea, or going on a walk outside and leaving your phone behind, give yourself + your mind a little chance to reflect and wander. Life's too short not to pause and enjoy it from time to time. \ud83d\udc9a\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#throughthewoods #portlandnw #pnw #live_PNW #pacificnorthwestisbest #washingtonstate #upperleft #liveauthentic #pnwonderland #traveloregon #findyourpark #findyourwild #ourwild #livewild #scenerypic #natureperfect #natureperfection #autumncolors #autumnvibes #autumnishere #helloautumn #loveautumn #myfavouriteseason #iloveautumn #seekthesimplicity #darlingdaily #mycanonstory #inspiremyinstagram #flashesofdelight #pursuepretty"

My family had a Greek deli growing up, and my dad was closing up for the night alone when three men came and asked to use the restroom. They robbed him at gunpoint, left, he called my mom who called the police, and then the men came back, realizing they left a witness behind. They told him to get down on his knees, they pointed the gun at his mouth, and they pulled the trigger.\n.\nMy dad lost 1/3 of his blood by the time the paramedics arrived. We arrived at the hospital later that night, and got to visit him in the ICU. As a little girl, my dad was my hero\u2014he was the strongest, biggest, toughest man I knew. Seeing him lying there with tubes coming in and out from all over him, unable to move or speak, with machines all around beeping and whirring, was the worst feeling I've ever experienced in my life. It was soul crushing.\n.\nHe was a miracle, though. The bullet shattered his jaw, exited his soft pallet, didn't hit his tongue (which could have made it impossible for him to speak again), and landed on his collar bone where it stayed put. This type of bullet was made to shatter upon impact to inflict the most damage, but miraculously it did not. My dad recovered and is alive and well to this day.\n.\nUnfortunately, my story is not unique. Thousands of other American families live this hell every year.\n.\nWhy?\n.\nGun violence should NOT be an acceptable part of our culture.\n.\nI am begging you, PLEASE vote for someone who will stand up to the NRA + make a policy change. Do not vote for the spineless cowards who have chosen to line their pockets with blood money from the NRA rather than to protect American citizens with the modernized gun regulations we so desperately need.\n.\nThis is literally a matter of life and death for ALL of us. If that doesn't motivate you to vote, what will?\n.\nIf not now, WHEN?\n.\nIf not you, WHO?\n.\n.\n#saynotofascism #voteblue #ivoted #fckyesimvoting"

Nearly 30 million Americans don\u2019t have access to affordable, quality, fresh fruits and vegetables. It\u2019s an issue affecting nearly one out of every 10 people across the country, and one of the saddest parts is that 60% of Americans don\u2019t actually believe this problem exists in their own community (hint, it definitely does!)\n.\nThrough the annual Drink Good Do Good campaign, @NakedJuice partners with @WholesomeWave to help increase access to affordable, quality, fresh fruits and vegetables. To build more awareness, this year\u2019s campaign is asking consumers to fill their carts for good by doing The Shopping Cart dance \u2014 everyone\u2019s favorite old-school dance move.\n.\n**For every Shopping Cart dance video, Boomerang or photo posted or shared with #FillYourCartForGood on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, Naked will donate the monetary equivalent of a cart of produce to communities in need.** So get down, get funky, and do The Shopping Cart dance to #FillYourCartForGood! Together we can make change happen \u2764\ufe0f"

Next year though, I'll make it happen. \ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\n.\nNow the garden looks very brown (and a little gold) and is in dire need of autumn tending. The wind has blown this archway over a bit, so that needs to be re-structured, and all the old tomato plants need to be pulled and composted. Plus the drip watering system need to be put away before the water inside it freezes. \u2744\ufe0f\n.\nWe're going to dive into tackling all that on Friday, really hoping the winds die down by then! They've been so biting and cold lately that it's been kind of painful to be outside at our place haha.

I get a moment to sit and think about what I *really* want and need to do, and then go about putting little things in their places, writing things that need to be written, and generally organizing everything I neglected in the sunny hustle and bustle of summer. \ud83c\udf2a\n.\nThere's something about the shorter days that relieves the pressure that I always feel in the summer to go outside and be productive. I always feel antsy to go outside and do active things while the sun's out. But now that so much of the afternoon is being lost to darkness, I feel like it's the earth giving me a little nod and letting me know that staying inside is just fine, indeed. So here I sit, typing away furiously at my keyboard between long hard thinks. \ud83e\udde0\n.\nThis morning I'm getting all my ducks in a row for Thanksgiving prep, writing up an outline for next year's creative mastermind, and drafting a survey for last year's workshop participants. \ud83d\udcdd I'm *realllly* excited to hear what everyone would like to learn in the advanced workshop I'll be hosting next year. Yay!\n.\nAs for this orange sweet, it's a tasty 'Spiced Baked Pumpkin' that's a cross between a very moist cake and pumpkin pie filling. It's a great option if you have any #glutenfree folks at the table. It's super dense, moist, and has the most delicious spiced autumn flavor.

You can peek at it via the link in profile \u261d\ud83c\udffc A few weeks back Jeremy and I went up to this area of Oregon known as the 'Fruit Loop' that has TONS of apple trees around, and we picked up some of the apples that went into this lovely pie! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n.\nWe do have a big old apple tree in our backyard, but the apples from it are very tart (I think they're cider apples) and always a bit wormy so I usually just leave those on the ground for the chickens to enjoy. \ud83d\udc14\n.\nAnd thanks so much all for you kind words + comments on yesterday's post, I really hope that things change for the better come Tuesday!

The filling is made with silky @vermontcreamery creme fraiche, which adds the best velvety texture to the custard and the slightest hint of tang. #keepitfraiche #ad\n.\nThere's also homemade butterscotch sauce incorporated both into the filling itself AND drizzled over the finished pie (YESSSS!), plus roasted pumpkin and a host of delicious autumnal spices.\n.\nIn the post I also have my top tips for making the perfect pumpkin pie, including using a bain marie in the oven while baking to prevent cracks from forming and to keep the filling nice and moist!

If you want to take your social media, blog, or brand to the next level, you *need* to take better photos. Make this the moment that you go all-in and actually invest in **yourself**!\n\ud83e\udd70\nIt took me 4 years of blogging before I decided to seriously pursue my passion as a full-time career, and I wish that something like my online course existed back then. I could have learned all the material in a several-week class that it took me several years to learn firsthand the hard way. All my experiences from over 8 years as a blogger and 15 years as a photographer are distilled down into this course.\n\ud83d\udcf7\nDon't just listen to me, @wildwoodfolk says \"This course is nothing short of magic. Eva gently draws back the veil and gives clear, simple, and richly detailed instruction. Instead of wasting hours searching the vast void of the Internet, I happily found that all the answers I sought have been neatly capsuled in this beautifully conducted course\"\n\ud83c\udf1f\nThis comprehensive photography, storytelling, and branding course contains hours of hands-on instructional videos, 9 different lessons, an e-book that contains all the video information in text-form, + 9 exercises to help you put the knowledge you've gained into practice.\n\ud83e\udd13\nYou can't get better without trying, so close the year with a step to enriching yourself! And as a visual learner, you get to actually see and visualize what I'm teaching firsthand through the videos. I'd love to help you create beautiful images, hope to \"see\" you soon!\n\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\n#foodstyling #foodphotographyandstyling #foodiegram #eatpretty #foodphotography"

A few months ago I made a borderline OCD excel spreadsheet with all the topics laid out that motivated me to vote and that I'd hope would motivate others to vote. In it I linked to source articles that talked about each point in more detail. It's pretty elaborate, and I'm linking to it in my profile today in case anyone still hasn't voted or made up their mind in their local elections (it's literally 99 rows long....brace yourself). \u261d\ud83c\udffc\n.\nTo be honest, reading through it both breaks my heart and enrages me. But, it also motivates me, which is a good thing. It makes me know in my heart that we can do better, and that the American people DESERVE better. Every one of us deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, whether we're born here, like I was, or come here in search of a better life, like my father did when he left Greece some 40+ years ago. When we cast our vote, we're demanding respect and creating a better tomorrow for ourselves, our fellow citizens, and for future Americans.\u2696\ufe0f\n.\nFish rot from the head. So if you dislike Trump and his policies, don't look only to him. Look to the political forces, policies, and parties that enable him. Look to your local officials who are enacting his will in your local community. By voting, you DO make a difference. You make a difference in your town, your state, and your country.\n.\nOur world is at a turning point, and I truly believe that this is the single most important election to ever take place. There is SO MUCH at stake here; so many civil liberties that have taken hundreds of years to enact could be taken away with one foul, cheeto-stained swoop. It is our time to get the representatives in place who will keep that from happening. \u270a\ud83c\udffd\n.\nPlease, VOTE! And tell your friends and family to vote! And post about voting! And treat yourself for voting! But most importantly, vote like your life as you know it depends on it because IT DOES. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n.\n.\n#votetoday #voteblue #saynotofacism #fckyesimvoting #ivoted #ivoted\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8"

The competition was fierce, but @ms_carolina_diaz of the US cinched the championship title with her incredibly flavorful + innovative dishes. She\u2019s the first woman to ever win the #PastaWorldChampionship (girl represent!!) <3\n.\nI drew a *ton* of inspiration from her, and you can read + see all about the competition via the link in profile! \u261d\ud83c\udffc And don\u2019t forget to bookmark this turkey tetrazzini recipe for the long holiday weekend!! #ad\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#firstweeat #eattheworld #heresmyfood #foodandwine #foodiegram #farmfresh #eatpretty #buzzfeedfood #todayfood #farmtofork #recipeoftheday #forkfeed #tastingtable #seriouseats #foodoftheday #insiderfood #lovecooking #homemadefood #seasonalfood #feedfeed #foooodieee #drooolclub #food4thought #foodadventure #foodieblog #foragebyfolk #instafood"
