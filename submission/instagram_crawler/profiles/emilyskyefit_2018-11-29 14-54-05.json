Babies don\u2019t ruin you, they make you better and stronger in so many ways!\nNever listen to the naysayers, they\u2019ll always be there criticising and waiting for you to fall. Be an example to them and show them how to stand back up if you fall and show them how to commit to the things you want in life. You\u2019ve gotta believe in yourself, ignore negative people and work your butt off!\nThank you to my beautiful Fit Fam and my followers for supporting me throughout my pregnancy and my journey into motherhood. I\u2019ve had some tough moments (more mental than physical) and you guys stood by me the whole way through. Some of you have supported me for years and I appreciate you all so much! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc97 You\u2019re amazing - never doubt yourself!\n.\n#10monthspostpartum #emilyskye #fitfam #fitmama"

I worked hard and consistently to get here without dieting or training more than an average of 4-5 hours a week (I mainly followed my FIT app).\nI\u2019m a much better and happier person and mother when I\u2019m active and healthy. I\u2019m SO grateful for my health. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\nIf there\u2019s something you want, even if it feels impossible to achieve at the time - BELIEVE YOU CAN GET IT! It takes time so don\u2019t be hard on yourself, it\u2019s not a competition between you and anyone else, and it\u2019s not about comparison. It\u2019s about dedicating yourself to becoming the best you can be and just doing the best you possibly can within your means. - I believe if dont like something and have the ability to change it then do it! \ud83d\ude0a\n.\nI really hope that by sharing my unfiltered postpartum journey I\u2019ve been able to inspire you to work hard to be the best you can be. You truly deserve it, I hope you know that. \ud83d\udc97 Thank you for being such an incredible support network for me. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc I appreciate you all so much. \ud83d\ude18\n.\nP.S.

Oooh the memories haha! \ud83d\ude48\n.\n6 weeks after I gave birth to Mia (after healing my ab separation) I attempted to do just 1 push-up and I couldn\u2019t do it! I\u2019d lost a lot of strength & I was so much heavier than I\u2019d ever been. I certainly didn\u2019t feel like a fitness guru! \ud83e\udd23 It was obviously well worth it all to have my precious Mia, but getting fit and strong again was important to me so I could feel good, be happy and be the best mum I could possibly be to Mia.\nIn the beginning I felt as if I\u2019d never get there - but I believed in myself, went into \u201crobot mode\u201d and just worked away at it. All of those midnight workouts I did (after Mia finally went to sleep) eventually paid off - even though I spent half the time cursing! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude48\n.\nIf you want to make a change with yourself it\u2019s important to have your big goal in mind, but don\u2019t let it overwhelm you. Focus on taking each day at a time and chip away at it. Be proud of each step you take towards your goal and stick at it. You WILL get there! \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude18\n.\n.\n#11monthspostpartum #betterthanever #fitmum #fitmom #postpartum"

Well it\u2019s been almost 9 years and @recdedmond and I are still going strong! \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc If only we trained as much as we argued we\u2019d be athletes! \ud83d\ude02\nDo you prefer to train WITH or WITHOUT your partner?\n.\nOn a serious note though I think it\u2019s important to have a partner who supports you and your healthy lifestyle.. and even better if they\u2019re active as well - it makes it so much more enjoyable! \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc .\n#strongertogether\n#fitcouple #coupleswholift"
