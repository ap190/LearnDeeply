Available only from @focus_gallery in Chatham, Massachusetts.\nI photographed my fist shark in the wild in 1982 and that experience had a profound effect on me. As a photographer, I find sharks an intoxicating subject, a perfect blend of grace and power. They move elegantly through the water yet exude a great confidence. In the decades since that first shark experience I find myself frequently working with these animals, trying to produce photographs that capture their essence. Nature has sculpted them to be perfect for whichever marine ecosystem in which they live. The Oceanic Whitetip in this photograph, is a true pelagic predator, living in the open sea in regions that have been called ocean deserts, where food is few and far between, so they must be especially efficient hunters. Their long pectoral fins are shaped like the wings of a glider, allowing them to cruise over long distances and save energy. The Oceanic Whitetip is a species on the brink however, having been hunted for their fins for decades. Their populations have declined up to 98% throughout much of their range.\nOn this day, the water was clear and the sun shined brightly in the sky. I dived down to a depth of about 10-meters and waited for the shark to swim into the ideal position, blocking the sun, creating a silhouette and accentuating its form. After lots of waiting and many attempts, I had the image that I had envisioned in my mind\u2019s eye. And now, it is available as an archival, fine art print. Follow the link in my profile to learn more about my collection at the @focus_gallery and see the full sized, large format photograph!\n\n#sharks #oceanicwhitetip #fineart"

This photograph shows a large pod of spinner dolphins socializing while swimming over a white sand bottom in the waters of Oahu, Hawaii. I was freediving to depths of 60-feet to make pictures of these animals. The water was warm and blue and being in the presence of these dolphins was hypnotic. Spinner dolphins are among the most social of dolphin species and are almost always seen in larger groups. Dolphins have the second largest brain relative to body size in the animal kingdom, after humans, but their world is vastly different than our own. Dolphins see much of their world acoustically, using echolocation (sonar) to determine objects and distances. When they sleep, they keep half of their brain awake, because they are voluntary breathers and also must remain vigilant for predators. But what else are they doing with those big brains in the sea? In the time ahead, perhaps these answers will be revealed.\nPhotographed on assignment for @natgeo with a Nikon D4 camera and 17-35mm lens.

While working on a dolphin story on assignment for @natgeo I saw this mother dolphin playing with a plastic bag. Dolphins often pick up objects floating in the sea, such as seaweed or leaves and play games, passing the object to another dolphin swimming behind them. In this case the adult dolphin passed the bag to her calf. The calf picked up the plastic bag and in the process the bag slipped over her head and formed a ring behind her eyes. I was swimming as hard as possible alongside and was trying to reach the calf to pull off the bag, but she stayed just beyond my reach. It was frustrating and horrifying to see this happening so closely and yet be unable to help. Eventually, the young dolphin leap into the air, twirling around, as spinner dolphins do to dislodge parasites (hence the name spinner dolphins). On her second attempt, the bag flew off of her head and she was free! I picked up the bag, brought it to the boat and disposed of it once back on land. Plastic is a serious problem for every creature on the planet.\n\n#spinner #dolphin #dolphins #ocean #underwater #photography #nationalgeographic #natgeo #travel #hawaii #oahu #water #tropical #animals #photooftheday #onassignment #nikonambassador #nikonnofilter #nikonlover"

Historically these animals have thrived in this region, where they come for a few weeks each year to engage in courtship, mating and pupping.\nDespite these behaviors, declining sea ice over the last decade - due to climate change - has caused problems for this species. Without stable ice, harp seal pups cannot suckle from their mothers, and often fall into the icy sea before they are physically prepared. Survival for this species is uncertain if such trends of climate change continue.\n#climatechange #seals #harpseal #canada #conservation #harp #seal #pup #gulf #stlawrence #canada #arctic #frozen #water #ocean #underwater #photography #wildlife #nature #national #geographic #natgeo #photooftheday #wonderlust #instagood\n#nikonlove #nikonambassador"

And you don\u2019t need to travel to Cape Cod to see this print or purchase one of the signed and numbered edition prints. You can visit the gallery\u2019s website by following the link in my Instagram profile.\n\nI made this photo in the waters off Nikumaroro in the Phoenix Islands (central South Pacific). This island is one of the places some historians believe Amelia Earhart crash landed. I was on a three week expedition for @natgeo exploring these remote reefs with a team of researchers. I prefer to photograph reefs in the early morning or at dusk, when light levels are low and I can create a dreamy effect of the busy motion of animals within these ecosystems. I was in shallow water near sunset, when this school of surgeonfish enveloped me as they swept over the corals, feeding and likely seeking shelter for the night. These fish have a striking, almost hypnotic color pattern on their bodies that morphs into vibrant yellow and purple hues on their fins. As with nearly all animals I\u2019ve encountered in the sea, they were well aware of me, but paid me little attention as they went about their business.\nBecause of the remoteness of these islands, they have remained relatively unspoiled. Coral cover is substantial and the many animals each play a vital role in the health if the habitat. The Phoenix Islands are owned by the country of Kiribati, which protected this region as a massive marine protected area.\nMy photograph, \u2018Painted Reef,\u2019 can now be owned in one of these large format fine art prints from @focus_gallery.\n\n#fineart #coralreef #kiribati #phoenisislands #pacific #focusgallery"

June 8, 2018\nOn this day, when the world celebrates the magnificence of Earth\u2019s oceans, I urge you to think about the need for conservation of our water planet.\nThe majority of where life can exist on Earth is water - 98% of our biosphere - yet only about 3% os the oceans are protected. Science tells us that for a healthy planet, at least 30% of the oceans must be protected.\nEvery other breath we takes comes from the sea, more than 50% of the oxygen needed to live is generated by the ocean. So if for no other reason than our own survival, ocean ecosystems must be conserved.\nThe oceans give us so many riches and taking care of the sea means a healthy future for all.\n#worldoceansday"

I will be at the headquarters of the @conservationlawfoundation and talking about the plight of the North Atlantic Right Whale - a species on the brink of extinction. I\u2019ll be joining Dr. Scott Kraus with the @newenglandaquarium , a leading right whale researcher working on solutions to save this species. Please check out this event here on my Instagram feed!\n\nThis photo shows a Southern Right Whale hovering inches above the sea floor in New Zealand\u2019s sub-antarctic waters. About a million years ago there was once species of Right Whale on Earth. But as land masses moved and oceans became separated, the right whales became separated too. Both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by early whalers, but the Southern Right Whales recovered better following protection, because they live further away from industrialization. The North Atlantic Right Whales are urban animals and live from Canada\u2019s Bay of Fundy to Florida. In these regions they become entangled in fishing gear and often die. They also get hit by ships. Last year (2017) 17 North Atlantic Right Whales were lost.\n\nLearn more about these amazing animals and how we can save them - here on my Instagram Live event on Tuesday at 12pm EST!\n#rightwhales #endangeredspecies #extinction #whales"

Manatees are vulnerable to a variety of threats, from loss of sea grass which they eat, to cold water temperatures, red tide and boat strikes. Habitat loss due to development over the decades has created a major problem for them as well. The recent red tide devastation has been especially difficult for many marine animals, including manatees.\nSpending time with this charismatic animals remains one of my finest wildlife experiences. While photographing a story about these animals I found myself never wanting to leave the water. I reluctantly dragged myself away at the end of each day when the sun was setting. With the sense of urgency becoming greater due to these latest toxic water problems, I hope you will take some time to learn more about manatees and help where you can!\n#manatees #florida #redtide #conservation #vote"

This population of humpbacks spends the summers feeding in Antarctica, migrating to warmer waters in winter where calfs are then born. The bond between moms and calves is strong, with calfs spending their first year with their mothers, during which time they nurse and are given protection. \nAlthough much has been learned about this remarkable species throughout decades of research, many mysteries remain with respect to humpback societies in the sea. The song of the male humpback, for example, has been described by scientists as the \u201chorizontal transmission of culture.\u201d Commonly believed to be a means of attracting females, the song of the male has never actually been observed as effective in finding a mate. Might there be greater complexities within these sounds? Further study will likely reveal fascinating aspects of the lives of these whales.\n\n@subal_underwater_housing\n#humpback #whale #humpbackwhale#follow #followme #photooftheday#cookislands #pacific #underwaterphoto#underwaterphotography #instagood#conservation #research #marinebiology #nikonlove #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador"

This marine protected area - located off of Ambergris Caye - was created in 1987, allowing marine life and ecosystems to thrive over the past three decades. Most researchers tell us that at least 30% of Earth\u2019s oceans must be protected in order to have a healthy planet, yet today only about 3% of these waters have been conserved. The ocean is the greatest carbon sink on Earth, taking in carbon and giving back oxygen.\nAs fish populations are decimated and increased amounts of carbon from fossil fuels are added to the water, ecosystems are destroyed and the ocean loses its ability to function efficiently. Creating more marine protected areas then is not only good for fish, but for all life on earth.\n#fish #underwaterphoto #underwater #natgeo #instagood #follow #travel #wonderlust #photooftheday #nikonlove #nikonambassador #nikonnofilter"

After humans, dolphins have the largest brains in the animal kingdom, relative to body size. Despite this fact, their world is very different than our own and the ways in which they use their brain is fascinating. Dolphins see much of their world acoustically, using echolocation (i.e. sonar) to determine the location of objects and distances. Dolphins also sleep with one half of their brains awake, as they need to be constantly alert for predators and because they are voluntary breathers.\n@thephotosociety @natgeocreative\n#bahamas #thebahamas #bottlenosedolphin #bottlenose #dolphin #spotted #tropical #tropics #ocean #caribbean #underwater #photography #national #geographic #natgeo #photooftheday #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador #nikonlove"

Much of what we think about white sharks is not true. They are not merciless hunters, are not always loners and may be far smarter than ever believed. I have always sensed a great cognitive ability in great white sharks, as they often seem to be sizing up a situation and figuring things out. I believe that in the time ahead, science will reveal that these animals are far smarter than ever believed.\n\nCheck out @newenglandaquarium to see more of my curated shark photographs!\n#sharks #greatwhiteshark #australia #predators"

Narwhals are the \u2018unicorn whale\u2019 due to their tusk, which is actually a canine tooth that protrudes from the animal\u2019s lip. Male narwhal tusks can grow to lengths of nearly nine feet. I made this picture from a helicopter at around midnight while on assignment for @natgeo. During the arctic summer, it is always light, which allows for long working days. We were living in tents on the beach and would journey out each day onto the pack ice to explore. After decades spent with wildlife, I still experience a thrill being in the presence of animals. And certain species, like narwhals continue to stir my soul. We see brief glimpses of them in surface waters, but I am intrigued by the portions of their lives that remain hidden and elusive. Their lives however are changing due to the decline of sea ice in the arctic and the future will likely be quite different for this mythical creature.\n#arctic #explore #climatechange #whales#underwater #nature #narwhal\n#nikonlove #nikonambassador"

The decline of sea ice is having an incredibly adverse impact on these animals.\n\nAs a result of anthropogenic climate change, it is predicted that - within the next several years - the North Pole will be free of ice in the summer, meaning that ships will be able to pass over the pole for the first time in recorded history.\nWhile such a trend may prove beneficial for shipping costs, such climate change threatens all of us. With each square mile of ice lost, more and more of the sun's energy becomes trapped in the atmosphere, expediting further climate change in the future.\n\n#climatechange #climate #climate #follow #followme #instagood #photography #photo #like #natgeo #wonderlust #canada #ice #globalwarming #saveourseas #photooftheday #polarbear #polar #bear #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador #nikonlove"

The largest fish in the sea, whale sharks were recently reclassified as an endangered species, with their numbers having being reduced by half according to recent studies. Whale sharks are plankton feeders, often moving slowly near surface waters as they feed. Their populations are being most impacted in regions such as Asia, where there is a demand for their fins.\nSwimming with whale sharks has long been one of my favorite experiences. They can be massive in size, yet so gentle, moving gracefully and purposefully through the sea. I feel that they are always quite aware of my presence, but rarely give me much thought. It\u2019s as if they are on an long and ancient journey and I am simply a momentary distraction.\n#whaleshark #australia #freedive"

This photo is now available as a Fine Art Print only from @focus_gallery in Chatham, Massachusetts. Click the link in my profile to see the full frame photo and to learn more about my exclusive collection of large format, limited edition, signed and numbered prints available through the Focus Gallery.\n\nDays before this photograph was made, President Obama created the world\u2019s largest marine protected area in the waters surrounding Midway Atoll by expanding the boundaries of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument. He traveled here to see firsthand this spectacular underwater ecosystem. I was honored to be invited to join him on this snorkeling adventure. I was on assignment for National Geographic magazine and knew that I needed to get the photo, so I was very focused on the job at hand. But I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of spending time at sea with the president and loved our conversation about the value of protecting the environment and especially the ocean. A few weeks after this, I was invited to the White House and gave President Obama the first copy of this print. Now, it is available to everyone!\n\nScientists tell us that to have a healthy planet, we must protect at least 40% of Earth\u2019s oceans. Today, only about 3% is protected, so we have a long way to go. But actions such as this, by world leaders, is a positive step in the right direction helping to ensure a vibrant future for all.\n#presidentobama #potus #midway #marinereserves #healthyoceans"

The exhibit features dozens of my shark photographs made throughout my career and offers a view of these animals that celebrates their magnificence. I am deeply honored to receive the David Brower Center\u2019s Art/Act award 2018. David Brower has been a hero of mine for decades and a great inspiration. From the photo exhibition - An Oceanic Whitetip Shark swims with a trio of pilotfish as an escort in the waters of The Bahamas. Once the most abundant large animal on Earth (large being defined as more than 100 pounds), the oceanic whitecap\u2019s stocks have plummeted 98% and the species is now on the verge of extinction. They have been hunted largely for their fins used in shark fin soup.\n@natgeo #sharks #savesharks #davidbrowercenter"

The water temperature here was 28.5-degrees F (almost minus 2 C), but exploring this realm of the harp seal was absolutely stunning. Unlike a frozen lake, the underside of this sea ice is like a mountainous terrain, with peaks and valleys. It is a convoluted and challenging world in which to navigate, at least for a diver, though the seals clearly have it well figured out. Unlike some species of seals, harp seals are not especially interested in humans and don\u2019t want to play. To produce underwater photos I often \u2018hid\u2019 amongst the ice and waited for them to dive down through small holes or through leads (cracks) in the the massive ice fields. For a story about these animals for @natgeo I lived on a fishing boat for weeks over two seasons and spent day and night with the seals.\n\nThinning ice due to climate change over the past decade has caused problems for this species, however. Harp seal pups need two weeks to nurse from their moms, during which time they build up fat and strength. If the ice is thin, then can fall into the sea before they are ready and die. In some, recent years, there has been no ice at all and the pup mortality rate rises dramatically. The future for this species remains uncertain.\n\n#harp # seal #cute #nature #cold #ocean #conservation #climatechange #nikonlove #nikonnofiter #nikonambassador #icediving"

Their cousins, the North Atlantic Right Whales, are the most endangered species of whale on Earth, with only about 450 remaining. Both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by early whalers, but the Southern species, while also endangered, recovered better, due to the fact that they live further away from human industrialization.\n\nBeing in this chilly water water with 45-foot long whales that weigh 70-tons was a little intimidating, but absolutely beautiful. As an underwater photographer, I cannot use long, telephoto lenses to photograph my subjects or wait in a camouflaged blind for days on end. I can only stay underwater as long as the air supply on my back lasts and must get very close to make pictures. When animals like these whales allow you into their world it is a very special experience.\nPhotographed on assignment for @natgeo\n#whales #nz #underwater #endangered #NikonLove #NikonAmbassador @subal_underwater_housing"

These animals forage in deep offshore water at night, then move into shallower regions to socialize and rest in the morning. With the clear water and white sand bottom, they appear to be flying through air. The Hawaiian spinners have a beautiful tri-coloration. These animals are considerably smaller in size compared to species like bottlenose. Spinner dolphins are among the most social of dolphin species, rarely seen alone or even in small numbers.\nSpending time in the sea with these animals is very special indeed. As with most creatures I photograph, my presence must be accepted for me to make a picture for I could never swim fast enough to photograph an animal that didn\u2019t want me near. But when animals like dolphins allow me into their world, even for brief periods, I am able to see amazing things. It is these moments that has inspired me for decades to travel widely and to endure many challenges. A small price to pay for the privilege of enriching my soul.\nPhotograph made under NMFS (NOAA) permit #17941.\n#dolphins #hawaii"

These animals can grow to be thirteen feet long and they feature a parrot-like beak that can remove quarter-sized chunks of flesh from their prey. The arms and tentacles of Humboldt Squid are lined with as many as 24,000 tiny \u2018teeth,\u2019 which they use to attack and hold their prey. Historically found in southern waters, Humboldt Squid have been forced northward by climate change and warming sea temperatures, with reports of Humboldt Squid sightings off of the Pacific Northwest of North America and in Alaska.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeocreative\n\n#humboldt #squid #cloud #ink #mexico #sea #of #cotez #tentacles #climate #change #global #warming #conservation #protection #nat #geo #underwater #photography #photooftheday #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador #nikonlove"
