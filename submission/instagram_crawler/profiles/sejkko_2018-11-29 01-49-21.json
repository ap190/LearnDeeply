We went from schorchio-summer to winter in like no time at all. But in the short in-between, the vibrancy of colour was briefly hypernatural \ud83d\udc96\n.\n."

My recent Fernwehallein project took over. Now as I am about to embark in my next project I thought it was only fair to release this piece into the world. The story of this house has to do with the sensation of a strong, yet gentle and deeply invigorating alpine breeze. Sunset oxygen - we all enjoy it in our core, in our own specific way.\n.\n.\nC-type 50x40cm - limited edition of 25.\n.\n#sejkko_lonelyhouses\n.\n."
