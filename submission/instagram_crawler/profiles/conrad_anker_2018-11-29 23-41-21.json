During the summer of 2002 the late Galen Rowell, Rick, @jimmy_chin & me embarked on a @natgeo expedition to document the migration and calving grounds of the endangered chiru, a small goat also known as the Tibetan antelope. The chiru is under pressure from poaching and habitat loss due to gold mining. Our goal was to supplement the work of the biologist George Schaller, encourage the Chinese government to expand the boundaries of the park these animals needed to survive and bring attention to illegal fur trade.\n\nFor 30 days we walked from the southern edge of the Chang Tang to the Taklimakan Desert, following the migration of these hardy animals. Over the 432 km (270 miles) of high altitude desert we didn\u2019t see a single tree. There were a few tiny plants, stipple grass and burzel, to support these antelope like caprids. The chiru is the food source for wolves and Tibetan bears. Luckily we didn\u2019t see any bears and the lone wolf we met was long in the tooth and curious. Perhaps the wolf understood we were not hunters and there by paid us a visit.\nOur own challenges were focused on finding water each day. (This image is from the last day.) From scooping up sand speckled snow to finding saline seeps water was a constant worry. After this journey we all had a deeper appreciation for water.\nOn this trip Galen opened up and shared his knowledge of photography with Jimmy. From the practical of how to care for your camera to the art of working the light Jimmy was a sponge. If there was one salient lesson it was work hard. Jimmy already had this built into his ethos, thanks to his dad. This was Galen\u2019s last expedition as he and his wife Barbara perished in a plane crash one month after the expedition.\nRick was a veritable encyclopedia of bird knowledge. For a more detailed overview check out the April 2003 National Geographic Magazine, available online in the digital archive. For an in depth look please read \u201cThe Big Open\u201d by Rick.\n#drogpapoints"

In 1984 he climbed a new route on the North Face of Everest with out supplemental oxygen. \u201cThe White Limbo\u201d ascent was the first time an Australian team made it to the top. And he did it in leather telemark boots as his standard high altitude kit was eaten by an avalanche. He went on to nab the second ascent of Gasherbrum IV in the Karakoram with Greg Child. He subsequently climbed Chomolungma again starting at the Bay of Bengal. This ascent was the start of @seatosummitgear, named after this journey. We spent two days in the Blue Mountains swapping tales and climbing with Mountain Youth Services Team, a program for at risk teens. We both firmly see the value of outdoor activity being the foundation of a healthy life style. He\u2019ll be joining me tonight at the Seymour Centre for a slide show at 7pm. @thenorthface_aunz"

He is standing proud with a hand on your shoulder in this kindergarten snapshot. Your father and I shared a fascination with gravity. The transformation of the human spirit when set in a situation of dire consequences was a connection that ran deep. We helped each other reach our goals. The moments spent on summits became our life summits.\nToday, as you turn 30, you are well aware that there are no guarantees in life. It was 19 years and 6 days ago that an avalanche swept your father away. I walked away. I\u2019ll never know why I survived. In the shadow of tragedy your mother, brothers and I found a solace that we knew was right for us. That you, the oldest of your mini bro-pack, welcomed me into your life was a foundation for the love that still reverberates and grows with in our family.\nFrom getting you to school on time to exploring the world there was never a dull moment. Being there for you as you graduated college and embarked on life\u2019s journey was a highlight for both your mother and I. That you have found a place in the same profession as Alex and I is heartwarming. Your mother and I are ever so proud of you. The stories you tell, in all mediums, help all of us recognize what it means to be human. You are doing great things.\nThis next decade begins with your most challenging and ambitious project yet. Your vision is to tell the story of your life: how it is shaped by the mountains and the people that define themselves by visiting the most inhospitable places on earth. How each of us is torn between a life of domestic happiness and a life on the edge of adventure. This is a big task. As you traverse the peaks and valleys of this project you will discover who you are.\nLike your father, you respond to challenge by working harder with increased dedication and focus. This drive is forever coupled with humor and happiness, as best expressed in the smile you had as a little shaver. This energy is still with you. You have a few more whiskers, yet this smile is all you.\nHappy Birthday!\nLove,\nDad\n@max.lowe #alexlowe"

He dedicates his winter to the pursuit of the ephemeral frozen waterfall. He rounds out the shoulder seasons with shoulder / core training in the fall and \u201chair boating\u201d (full value kayaking) in the spring. The South Fork of the Shoshone drainage is located in the Shoshone National Forest.\nToday is the 25th Anniversary of the National Public Lands Day. It is a sweet reminder of how precious the shared lands are. The cliffs are winter range for the Big Horn sheep. In between is world class ice climbing.\n\n2018 is also the 50th Anniversary of the National Trails System and the popular National Wild & Scenic Rivers System.\nIntegral to all of these public lands is the funding provided by the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Please, if you live in the US, call your Senator and Congress-person and advocate for full funding of the LWCF. Vote comes up end of September.\nWild places are the best thing we can leave for future generations. It\u2019s the right & responsible thing to do.\n#findyourpark #publiclands #savelwcf #finealpineadventure"

Layer up experiences and we have happiness.\nA detractors of climbing posit that it is selfish. It\u2019s a game that serves no purpose for no discernible end. This view that what is fun has limited value and benefits the person and not society applies to all recreation. We work to earn money. We trade our time and knowledge to institutions, collectively creating goods and services to be consumed by our fellow humans, in return for money. We earn money so we can do fun things. Recreation is basically fun and it rejuvenates the soul. Volunteering as recreation aside, all pastimes are inherently selfish. From bowling to bouldering and fishing to free soloing we work so that we can recreate. This is, after all, what is special about life.\nSpending time with your family makes recreation even more wonderful.\n@iloweanker moving two at a time with a solid belay from @ashanoski on 2.5 billion year old Gneiss.

This snapshot has us enjoying a warm beverage and shooting the breeze after a day in the mountains. One piece hardshell outfits were \u201cde rigueur\u201d back then.\n_____________________________\n\nDave introduced me to the 1999 Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition. We topped out on the 17th of May, via the NE Ridge, in somewhat adverse conditions. Thirteen years later we were at the same place on the 26th of May 2012 with @melissaarnot and @khfilms, climbing from Nepal. It was warm and windless - Dave noted it was the best weather he had ever seen on summit day. A few years before, Dave joined @ivo_ninov, @jimmy_chin and me for an ascent of the Pacific Ocean Wall on El Capitan. It\u2019s worth looking up his story for Outside Magazine, \u201cAces High\u201d about this adventure. We\u2019ve crossed paths on Denali & Kilimanjaro and always joke about the expired mashed potatoes we subsisted on while living in the blue weather port at Vinson Base Camp.\nDave is the one of the funniest and most gentle guys around."

Not wanting to accelerate the toxicity of on line conversation (call\nit bullying if you like) I returned to landscapes, adventure and the standard FOMO content you have thumbed through till you landed here.\nAs a citizen of the United States the values our nation are founded on are dear to me. I came of age during the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War. Our nation, to a degree, had come to terms with its history. Based on the the values of free speech and equality, all are (in theory) welcome to the pursuit of happiness.\nSince the election of President Trump the values of our country have been compromised. The honor and integrity of our nation\u2019s highest office doesn\u2019t effuse chivalry and courtesy. It has become a pulpit for an unprecedented quest for power. President Trump stokes this fire of power by marginalizing minorities. In doing so he creates strife and discord. The Native American, African American, Hispanic, Muslim and LGBTQ communities have been subject to derision and insult. Women, from all walks of life, have felt the brunt of this narcissistic man\u2019s ire. This is not how I ever expected a President to behave.\nPublic lands, health care and climate are three areas that this generation can act on for the benefit of future generations. Given this opportunity for legacy, President Trump has instead focused on short term results that benefit the wealthiest 1% and special interest groups.\nPresident Trump and the complicit Republican Party have taken the moral compass of our nation and spun it towards greed and avarice. Candidate Rosendale is basing his campaign on allegiance to President Trump. This is not a platform that works for me. By contrast @jontester is a farmer from Big Sandy and is a centrist, having bills signed by President Trump. Tester represents Montana.\nI\u2019m Conrad Anker and these are my opinions.\n\n@pow_action_fund #dropinandvote #yourvoicematters"

From the beech forests of Rob Roy in NZ to the beaches of Manly in Oz, @jenniloweanker and I had a fantastic time. \u2022\u2022\u2022 On Sunday we had the chance to climb in the Blue Mountains in \u201ccharacter building\u201d conditions. The night before left us with a solid frost (it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere) and the 2 degrees celsius temps in the shade were down right bone chilling. Layer up 60 km/hr winds and nature brought out the finest in us. Local grip master @leecossey shared a classic trad route on Pierce\u2019s Point, complete w three rusted \u201ccarrots\u201d. What looks like a climbing anchor is a taper ground machine bolt. To keep it real one has to pull a hanger from your chalk bag, fiddle it onto the relic, clip a draw and then clip the rope. It\u2019s the secret why Australian climbers are so strong. @angiescarthjohnson is a local crusherette with hard sends - all at the age of 14. This was her first trad climb and her first chance to get the screaming barfies. It was nice to meet her parents and see the drive she has for climbing. Between Lee, Angie and I, we had three generations of climbers - each 20 years apart. What fun to see the same level of excitement and stoke for the frivolous game of gravity! Looking forward to our next climbing adventures in Australia and New Zealand. #finealpineadventure"
