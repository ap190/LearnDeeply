As this frozen landscape continues to change so do the hunting grounds for these apex predators, often culminating in territorial stand offs. It was truly humbling to get the green light from @paulnicklen to jump in and make some still images of these amazing animals. My role was behind the video camera but he knows me well, so he arranged for me to experience this once in a lifetime opportunity before we set sail. A true leader. Unforgettable. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc. Shot #onassignment for @natgeo @sealegacy // @paulnicklen @cristinamittermeier @craigwelch @ladzinski"
