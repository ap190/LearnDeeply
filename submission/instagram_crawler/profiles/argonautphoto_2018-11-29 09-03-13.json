Archeological finds in the Gulch reveal thousands of years of human habitation, primarily as the home to the Ancestral Pueblo people, and still contains many of the remains of their homes, kivas, and granaries. Concentrations were especially high in the Basketmaker II period starting in 500 BCE. From my current cover story in @natgeo magazine."

Looking up at the sky through Zebra, shot on assignment for @NatGeo photographing the slot canyons in Southern Utah. Im out here photographing sites that were recently removed or otherwise affected when the Monument was shrunk by around %50 and split into 3 smaller units by Executive Order. These slots were not removed but the trail to get to them, and the larger buffer area around them were removed opening the area for potential resource extraction. Watch my IG story feed in the coming days for video and stills from these slots!"

This is a virtual model (made up of thousands of photographs stitched together into a virtual object) of Ancestral Pueblo granaries on Cedar Mesa, in what was formerly #bearsearsnationalmonument in Utah. This looks like video but it\u2019s actually #photogrammetry. This project to create scientifically accurate models for conservation and education was created with my partner @devlin_gandy and made possible by a grant from @insidenatgeo. These experiences can be shifted to provide ways for elders to visit Ancestral sites, for kids in urban areas to learn about other cultures and times through VR in the classroom, and the models themselves can be used by archaeologists around the world to study changes over time and to create accurate measurements virtually. We also hope to use these to educate the public about the importance of these cultural heritage sites without them having to visit in person when they are either too sensitive or too remote to access. Important note: we did not enter these structures, we used small cameras with lights on poles to create the images that were stitched to firm the interiors. Never enter a structure like these if you happen upon them! For more about Bears Ears checkout my current cover story in @natgeo magazine! And for more info about site etiquette and how to #VisitWithRespect visit @cedarmesafriends."

You are looking at a perfectly preserved Kiva in #BearsEarsNationalMonument, Utah, with storytelling by @marlon.magdalena from Jemez Pueblo. You can find the link to the full interactive version of this in the link in my header (first download the \u201cYouTube\u201d app to view it and after clicking the link be sure to then click \u201copen app\u201d at the top). While this looks like a video, the world you move through is actually a virtual model that takes you into the various rooms of the 800-1000 year old dwelling and ceremony room of this Ancestral Pueblo site. (From the BLM: While this includes a digital simulation of a fire inside the Kiva, building fires within cultural resource sites on public lands is illegal and can damage the integrity of the site). My partner in this project was @devlin_gandy and we were able to make this experience thanks to funding from @insidenatgeo and National Geographic magazine, and the video with the help of @max.salomon from @blackdotfilmsvr! LINK IN HEADER! Special thanks to our field producer and cultural advisor Kevin Madalena (@jemezscientist_occamschainsaw)! We couldn\u2019t have done it without you! #photogrammetry"
