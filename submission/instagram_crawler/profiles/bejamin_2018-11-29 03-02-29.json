A conscious love of being, without a care for having been.\n.\nThis image was created last spring with a @hasselblad H6D for the 2018 Hasselblad Masters Book now in print. The cloud lasted about 15 seconds. As in most of my images, I\u2019m fascinated by the process where multiple moments and views condense into one. The cloud, sky, dunes, and grass; each were sought with individual intentions for a final whole. In painting, it\u2019s understood that these are referenced or imagined moments, there is no confusion about reality or time. In photography, the light is good then gone, the cloud is there then not. These moments all happened, but when cut apart and reassembled, where is their combination? Like the cloud gains a persona with a specific arrangement of vapor, the image gains a location with a specific arrangement too. I\u2019m always fascinated by the moment of transition. The most fun creativity, usually feels like discovery."

Am I racing off ahead of now, searching the horizon? But right here, there is a quiet stillness, then a shift, did the sail just fill? It must have, ripples on the bow, the centerboard knocks, the tiller softly pushing back.\n.\nI thought the drone would be a great way to capture that feeling, but some surprising things happen when you fly from a small sailboat. First, the downforce of the rotors creates enough wind to sail by, and second, landing is a challenge when the closer you get the faster you go. All this is compounded by a very tippy little boat and a flopping sail next to spinning propellers; more exciting than usual.\n.\nShot on @djiglobal \u2018s #Mavic2Pro #SeeTheBiggerPicture"

First contraction, then expansion. And if you are quite enough, you can hear small grains of sand adjust to the breathing ground.\n.\nLast spring I spent a month living out of my car in the desert, to work on a series of images for the @Hasselblad Masters book.\n.\nI recently meet up with the Hasselblad team and the other masters, for awards, and the unveiling of the finished book. What an amazing final product. I\u2019m incredibly fortunate to be connected with such a wonderfully talented group. Both those behind the cameras, and those behind the making of the cameras. Plus, it\u2019s pretty darn cool to see your work published. A first for me."

In providing Shelter and Fire, don\u2019t destroy the ecosystem that provides Food, Air, and Water.\n.\nIf I pushed a personal agenda, (long term enjoyable survival of all Earths inhabitants) I\u2019d tell you to vote. Vote for politicians who are skilled at balancing the most inclusive, wholistic view possible. #CreativesVote\n.\nOr, perhaps you agree with George Carlin; the Earth just wanted plastic, and now the humans can all go away, thank you very much. #savethehumans"
