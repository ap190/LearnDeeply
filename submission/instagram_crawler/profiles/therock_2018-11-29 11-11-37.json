Many of you know my history;)\n\u202aI knew it was a story that I had to tell along with our @sevenbucksprod team.\nThat girl who I saw in that documentary would go on to superstardom as the @RealPaigeWWE along with her relentless female co-workers wound help redefine and usher the spectacular @WWE women\u2019s wrestling the world enjoys today.\nThe PERFECT actress to embody Paige and bring her story to life is my homegirl and absolutely brilliant actress @florencepugh. Florence took \u201ccommitment\u201d to the next level.\nTo write and direct this unique, one of a kind wrestling \u201cslice of life\u201d comedy is my long time buddy, brilliant collaborator and twin, @stephenmerchant.\nHere\u2019s a taste of our first trailer.
