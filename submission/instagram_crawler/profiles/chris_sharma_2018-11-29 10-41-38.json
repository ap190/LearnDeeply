I just want them to follow their passion and be happy and themselves.\nNot sure if it\u2019s an auspicious sign but just saying ... he was born at 5:15 am"

Perched 70ft above the Balearic Sea.. @chris_sharma found a nook just big enough to pause before jumping into the water & swimming to the boat. This tiger striped line was one of the many new & old Deep Water Solo lines Chris climbed during the 24 hours we spent with him in Mallorca. Days prior Chris had just welcomed his son into the world... Julian. This trip was a quick moment for chris to reflect on the things he loved most. Hours later he was back with his family & newborn. I\u2019ve never seen anyone climb with as much passion as chris does. Excited to share more of this trip in the weeks to come. .\n\nOn assignment for @prana\n@chris_sharma"

It brings back lots of memories from when I first climbed it in 2006. Such a pivotal moment in my climbing and my life. It\u2019s great to see Jan go through a similar process. Although no one would deny that #psicobloc is the funnest form of climbing, but practiced at the highest level it requires a completely unique skill set beyond just being able to climb hard. Dealing with the sea conditions, the logistics of wet shoes, chalk bag and rock; one has to embrace all these things as part of the process. Luckily a line like #EsPontas is so incredibly inspiring that even when it doesn\u2019t come together it\u2019s always time well spent and keeps you coming back! Good job Jan! \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4dpsycued to see the video from @joaogiacchin"
