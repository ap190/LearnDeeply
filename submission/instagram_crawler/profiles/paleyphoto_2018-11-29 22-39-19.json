Wakhi is rarely spoken by foreigners and it took me years to pick it up, often during long treks. Entering a home, saluting \u201cmum\u201d, greetings my \u201csisters\u201d, I always have to go through a round of questioning, it can be endless... Having the mouth of a foreigner wording their words, some more intimate than others, can be a source of laughter and surprise - sometimes suspicion. It\u2019s definitely a great kick, but if I start playing with it then the attention stays on me and I don\u2019t want that. Given time, the dust eventually settles, and I get taken into the intimacy of the words I used, a gift for taking time.

The next day, because of a mix up, Paul and I were arrested by the Pakistani secret service. Here is an extract from Paul\u2019s evocative text, describing that unexpected turn of event (September issue of National Geographic magazine):\n\"Early that morning, in a coarse ice mist, we set out with two pack donkeys to climb Irshad Pass [...]. Climbing a mountain under such conditions is a strange and disorienting experience. It was like scaling a frozen and crazily tilted sea [\u2026]. We tottered along ice-rimed cliffs. Snow hid fatal crevices. Sometimes the donkeys fell through the crust and refused to get up. [\u2026] By midday a blizzard was in full gust.\n\u201cHello, Arthur, can you do me a favour?\u201d Paley was shouting into the satellite phone. We couldn\u2019t see a hundred steps ahead, much less the peaks far above. Paley\u2019s brother in Paris googled and read out to us the GPS coordinates for Irshad.\nIrshad Pass rises 16,335 feet above sea level. We finally reached it at sunset. Paley ventured a feeble victory dance. I gulped air so thin and metallic it cut my lungs like razor blades. Gales had scoured the summit to raw bedrock. Without shelter or firewood, it was a hazardous place to camp. But we had little choice. [\u2026]\nPlainclothes Pakistani security forces confronted us the next night while we camped at the eastern end of the Hindu Kush. We had notified the government of our plan to enter Pakistan via Irshad. We carried valid visas issued in advance. But the officers, armed with AK-47s, insisted we had trespassed into a restricted zone. Overnight, they drove us to the frontier town of Gilgit. In detention there, I overheard Paley, curled on his cot, parroting in his emphatic Norman accent the lines from a film playing on his hidden mobile phone: \u201cAn eye for an eye only ends up making zee whole world blind.\u201d \u201cMatthieu,\u201d I whispered, \u201care you watching Gandhi in an intelligence agency safe house?\u201d / with @outofedenwalk and @arthurpaley\n#Karakoram #hindukush #mountainpass #afghanborder #natgeo #mediumformat"

Sidol, Jumagul and Assan Khan were just back from checking the growth of grasses at a lower elevations. That grass will be used for animal fodder in the winter months. They drove those 1000Kg beast with incredible skills, down steep valleys across rivers, blissfully unaware of their cool factor.
