Unfortunately, when I arrived at the location I found out that the viewpoint would have closed before sunset. \ud83d\ude2f\nAs I am a \"blue hour\" kind of guy, I was pretty upset about this, as well as the guys next to me. In fact, just beside me, there was a @bbc crew which was there filming some B-roll for a documentary.\ud83c\udfa5\nWe didn't capture the blue hour, but we somehow managed to stay well over the closing time and get the last rays of the sun, which as you can see from the picture create a beautiful effect.\nAll this was possible thanks to a super cool LAPD officer, which was there on duty and allowed us to stay 40-min longer. \ud83d\ude4f\nHis act of kindness & understanding allowed the crew to get their job done, and me to shoot at a time of day where I normally don't, letting me go out of my \"photography comfort zone\".\nThank you buddy \ud83e\udd1c\ud83c\udffb\u2728\ud83e\udd1b\ud83c\udfff\n#smallthings",

The Santa Monica Pier is such an iconic location that definitely deserved its own shooting\ud83c\udfa2\n.\nI arrived, positioned my tripod between the sand and the water, and waited.\nAs soon as the sun went down, the sky got illuminated by this gorgeous warm light, a gentle breeze was touching the sea; everything was perfect.\ud83e\udd29\n.\nSo perfect that a young couple went with their feet inside the water, and started to hug during the best moment, just in the middle of my frame \ud83d\ude05\nI wanted to go there and kindly ask them to move just a bit (I don't think they had noticed me), but I decided that their special moment was more important than my picture.\n.\nThat was a REALLY long hug, something like 10-15min, and when they went away the sky wasn't that nice anymore.\nGladly, with some Photoshop magic, I was able to \"kindly remove them\" from my shot.\nAt the end of the day, we all got what we wanted: I got my shot, and they got their beautiful memory \ud83d\ude42",
