I was in Seattle last night and Portland tonight - pretty cool to see the film spreading around the country.

I haven\u2019t gotten to see all the other films yet but I\u2019m looking forward to seeing @adam.ondra flash 5.15 and all the competitive speed climbing. Find your local Reel Rock screening to get your dose of climbing inspiration (if the other two feature films that came out recently weren\u2019t enough...). Also, Cedar has been asking me to go back to Antarctica on a self supported Sufferfest3 style expedition. Good idea or bad idea?!"

For those asking about screenings in specific cities (or Europe, or Canada, etc) - be patient, it\u2019s expanding each week. And eventually it\u2019ll be on TV and streaming online. But it\u2019s definitely way better to see on the biggest screen possible - you have to do El Cap justice!"

The Free Solo premier was surprisingly powerful and seeing how the film affected audiences was inspiring.\nAnd the outdoor recreation opportunities around Telluride kept it all pretty fun! The whole crew got to go adventuring on the via ferrata - one of the highlights for sure.\nThe journey continues at the Toronto International Film Festival this week - probably more gym time and fewer mountains..."

It\u2019s opening in New York and LA on the 14th and then appearing as a one night event in theaters all over the country on the 19th. I\u2019ve heard that tickets are selling out so get yours soon. It\u2019s a great film, stoked for everyone involved. @senderfilms @brettlowell @joshlowell\nAnd yes, I know it\u2019s confusing timing that there are two different feature films coming out about climbing on El Cap at almost the same time. When it rains it pours. So much psyche!"

As a Sacramento native it\u2019s nice to be recognized by a magazine that\u2019s been around Northern California for almost 20 years. And in a more general sense, I\u2019ve been really humbled by the reception to Free Solo this weekend - it\u2019s really been powerful to see how it affects audiences. Free soloing is such a personal pursuit, it\u2019s interesting to share it on a big screen. I\u2019m really grateful that Chai Vasarhelyi (@mochinyc) and @jimmy_chin did such a great job crafting the film. Check Freesolofilm.com for screenings (link in bio). And don\u2019t worry, more are constantly being added. It\u2019ll eventually be everywhere."

They\u2019ve released the Freerider chalk bag (the same bag I used on the actual climb, and signed), and a new, signed version of the classic Solution harness. They\u2019re both products that I\u2019ve used forever so I\u2019m happy to promote them. But more importantly I\u2019m glad that a percentage of sales go to the @honnoldfoundation. Thanks!

For those in Europe and the rest of the world: have patience, it\u2019s rolling out over the next few months. And it will eventually show on the @natgeochannel and then be online in some way. Sorry I don\u2019t have more details, I honestly don\u2019t know what the whole plan is.

I\u2019ve never really liked gifts, and I don\u2019t need much, but last year my girlfriend\u2019s family started what will hopefully be a tradition of donating to the @honnoldfoundation for my birthday. And that\u2019s something I can appreciate. So for anyone who wants to get me a birthday present or wish me well, please consider setting up a recurring donation at the link in bio.\nAny amount is appreciated - and every amount has an impact. Depending on where you live, $6 can buy you a cup of coffee or a couple tacos. But for a family living in rural Malawi, $6 can buy a solar lantern - a lantern that can provide free, sustainable light, and replace the old kerosene lamp that filled their house with a toxic black cloud.\nUse the link in my bio to set up any kind of donation. Thanks.\n@tedhesser photo from an expedition to Kenya."

Anyway, Jordan made a fun little story about our day, check out @cannonjtc for the adventure.\nThis is my new strategy - let my partners shoot things so I never have to...\nThanks @samuelcrossley for the summit pic with the afternoon\u2019s objective in the background.\nI think this wraps up my Valley season - too hot now and time to move on. Lots of ups and downs this season; Yosemite is always giving and taking away. Lots to think about."

It\u2019s been a great break from film touring to spend a weekend in beautiful mountains with such caring and engaged people. One of the big themes of Outwild has been focusing on values and using them to lead a more intentional life - it\u2019s been a good reminder for me to just post about the things that I truly care about. I guess the weekend has helped me tap back into some of my idealism. Along those lines - take advantage of a beautiful Sunday to go early vote (unless you\u2019ve already voted by mail). Elections matter - help govern. (We voted last week in NV, my first time doing so physically after a decade of voting by mail in CA. Pretty exciting.)"

But I\u2019m even more excited that now that the film is being released I can finally see all the pictures that @jimmy_chin has shot with me over the last few years of film making. I never got to see any of the material while we were shooting - seeing it now is a nice way to revisit two years of great climbing. This is a shot of Freestone, a route that, as the old guide book said, is probably harder than Astroman (despite being shorter). And being up there with Yosemite Falls raging behind definitely adds to the ambiance. Gotta love Yosemite! @natgeo @mochinyc\nAnd for anyone curious: @freesolofilm opens in theaters September 28th. Get psyched!"

Visionary climber and photographer (and gear tinkerer), but more importantly a genuine, kind, and positive man.\nHe came up to the Valley for moral support when @hansflorine and I set the speed record on the Nose in 2012. He joked that while us shaving 9 minutes or so off the record was impressive, it paled in comparison to the 40 odd days that he shaved off the record on the second ascent.\nOne of the highlights of last fall was doing an interview with Tom in El Cap Meadow for an upcoming documentary about his life from Flatlander Films. To hear his account of the first ascent of the Salathe while looking up at the wall was truly inspiring. Thanks, Tom."

I\u2019ve been a vegetarian for 5 or 6 years because I considered it the easiest way to minimize my environmental impact. I think it\u2019s fitting that Beyond Meat uses the tag line \u201cthe Future of Protein\u201d because I genuinely believe that making meat directly from vegetable protein is the way of the future. Why use an animal as a grossly inefficient middleman when it\u2019s possible to make meat directly from a plant without having to butcher another creature?! The Beyond Burger tastes and feels like an old school beef burger but with a tiny fraction of the environmental impact and none of the cruelty. Basically, I\u2019m honored to partner with Beyond Meat because I hope that they\u2019re shaping the future. A cleaner, lower impact way to eat - definitely the future. #gobeyond #futureofproteinambassador"

Chai technically co-directed the film with @jimmy_chin - but everyone knows how much time Jimmy likes to spend skiing... Chai\u2019s the powerhouse who actually did the hard work of crafting the film. @freesolofilm is still in theaters all over the country (just got a text from a laggard aunt of mine who\u2019s just getting around to seeing it). Still time to appreciate Chai\u2019s hard work."
