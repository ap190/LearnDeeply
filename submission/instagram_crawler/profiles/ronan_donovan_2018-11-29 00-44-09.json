I took this photo during a brief pause while the team searched for the Pablo group of Mountain Gorillas. For 12 days in a row, we hiked up to find this gorilla group and to document their daily lives for National Geographic Magazine @natgeo. Learn more about the status of Mountain Gorillas in Rwanda in the current issue of National Geographic Magazine with story by Elizabeth Royte titled The Gorillas Dian Fossey Saved.

It represents land that used to be gorilla habitat, land where humans and gorillas are coming into contact as gorillas begin day trips across this edge to feed on tamed crops - introduced eucalyptus and native bamboo.

As the unprotected forests are cleared, wild animals are forced to look elsewhere for food. Since a taboo against consuming primates exists in Uganda, the chimpanzees remain in these tiny slivers of forests. After years of negative interactions with humans, chimpanzees have become aggressive towards people as the chimpanzees are forced to raid crops and wander past village homes.\nI'm currently in the field exploring stories similar to Teddy's.

My first wildlife job out of college was monitoring the nesting success of spotted owls in Yosemite National Park as part of an ongoing fire fire ecology study. It was 2006 and I drove from Vermont to Yosemite with a used film camera I'd just bought on eBay. I spent the summer learning about what it meant to be a naturalist, about the importance of conserving wild things and wild places and learning from friends along the way. That summer became the foundation for the work that I'm doing now. It has been an immense joy to return and to remember those days. Thank you @mcdonald.mike.a for spending a few late nights in the old growth forests searching for owls again and for continuing to teach me. And thanks @yosemitenps for preserving this place. Check out my Instagram story for some behind the scenes for this photo.",

Teddy lay unconscious high up in a tree in the clutches of a wild chimpanzee. Her arm was broken at the elbow so severely that it was only being held on by a thread of flesh, likely broken while being dragged through this ordeal by the chimpanzee.\nAs the men began desperately chopping down the tree, the chimpanzee tore a chunk of flesh out of Teddy's head before casting her to the ground in its effort to flee the scene.\nTeddy was rushed to the hospital where the doctor decided to amputate her arm. She spent seven months in the hospital recovering from her injuries....\nI'm currently in the field exploring stories similar to Teddy's. I'll post a series of photos of Teddy and the rest of her story over the coming days. Please stay tuned.",

Of the nearly 60 mountain gorillas that I spent time with during my assignment for National Geographic Magazine, Ubwuzu's personality stands out in my memory. His age makes him a curious teenager, playful with his peers and even though he grew up being watched daily by researchers, he still shows an interest in his fellow apes. Learn more about the status of Mountain Gorillas in Rwanda in the current issue of National Geographic Magazine with story by Elizabeth Royte titled The Gorillas Dian Fossey Saved. Link in my bio. Thanks to @savinggorillas for all their conservation work and for the on-the-ground support while I was on assignment.

This is just weeks after I bought my first DSLR camera after using slide film for the previous year. I remember sprinting over the rocky mountainside to get into position for this photo. Taken in Gran Paradiso National Park in northern Italy, this image was captured early on in my obsession with photographing wildlife. I was traveling through Europe for the first time. I rarely went to the cities or cathedrals or to the museums. I wanted to see the natural cathedrals of Europe. I figured the museums will always be there and when I'm unable to hike in the mountains is when I'd explore the human history of Europe.",

But the reality is that hyenas are among the most successful of Africa's hunters - leopards and wild dogs. Initially thought to make a living by steeling food from lions and other predators, it's the opposite that is often the case. As a group, hyenas have upwards of a 30% success rate in making kills, which is high for predators. Compared to lions, at around 20%, hyenas do well to make their own meals. Having spent time watching wolf dens, I was surprised by how doting hyena siblings were on the younger pups. Careful, playful and firm when lessons were needed - but never overly aggressive - these hyenas taught me how they raise the next generation. I was pleasantly surprised, as I often am when confronted with how fellow social mammals rear their own.",

The story goes that when Europeans first saw this bird they thought the feathers on its head resembled that of a stately European gentleman of the time, secretaries. Well I like to imagine it's named for the way this bird of prey deals with the critters it hunts. They do so by dancing on top of their prey with great gusto in order to kill or stun the animal (snakes, lizards, insects etc). Perhaps those that named the secretarybird related this behavior to the frantic typing of a secretary\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f check out the cover of @natgeo January issue for an amazing portrait of this bird by @joelsartore this year, @natgeo is celebrating the centennial of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

Raised in rural Vermont, my parents never forced a man-made theology upon my brother and I. Instead, they allowed us to experience the physical world that wasn\u2019t created by man. The thunder, the cold winters, the spotted salamanders, the spring peepers, the night sky, the goldfinches, ravens, evening grosbeaks, ruby-throated hummingbirds, the taste of wild blackberries, summer squash from the garden, and countless other life experiences that cannot be found behind walls. If I worship any one thing, it would be the sun for it brings life to all things on Earth. I feel its warmth on my face, I long for its return in winter, I know its wrath when I expose my skin too its rays for too long, and I see the life it brings all over the world with my own eyes. I believe in what I see and what feels real to me. I worship healthy ecosystems because they bring life to us all. Where is your church? #newmexico #travel #blackandwhite #landscape #infrared",
