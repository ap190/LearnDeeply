This place was straight out of a fairytale\ud83e\udd84, tucked away in some mountains. \ud83d\uddfbWhen you approach, you see a little stream at the base\u2026 It\u2019s hard to guess what\u2019s inside. There were trees \ud83c\udf32at the mouth of the canyon and every little twist and turn was a delight. There\u2019s mist rising all over the place from the spray \ud83d\udca6and the light shining in from the top gives it a cathedral like, ethereal quality. We only went there at once in the afternoon, but I\u2019m sure it looks different at different times of the day with the light \ud83c\udf24 hitting different walls! Not to mention how it looks in the winter with the final waterfall freezing up\u2026 \u2603\ufe0f So cool! And, as I mentioned, not one other person in site the entire 2 hours we spent exploring it! \ud83d\udeb6\ud83c\udffbTomorrow I\u2019m going to post a video \ud83c\udfa5with some shots from this canyon\u2026 Hope you enjoy this as much as I do. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00"

With all that I\u2019ve visited and seen, a helicopter flight over Kauai\u2019s Na Pali Coast still ranks as the best helicopter flight I\u2019ve ever done\u2026 \u26f0\ud83d\ude81 This is the 4th time I\u2019ve done the same flight! To me, it\u2019s the most beautiful, dynamic mountain range on earth. I\u2019ve boated into its caves, swam at its foot, hiked on its ridges and flown over it\u2026 It never disappoints! Any time of the year, any time of the day it\u2019s wonderful, and a different experience. This is the first time I\u2019d flown around mid day\u2026 normally, not a great time for landscape photos. But just look at the result! I had the time of my life, with one of my besties @andrew.studer and new friend @ryanbraden - his first helicopter ride! Way to begin your Heli Life!\nKauai is the oldest Hawaiian island and the OG Hawaiians lived in these valleys for centuries. The last Hawaiians moved out in the 1930s. Now you can hike and even camp near the beach with a permit, but very few get to do this. That\u2019s one of the reasons this place has remained so beautiful. The unique look of the valley spire is the result of the weather system created by island itself\u2014tons of rain, and wind and the ocean\u2019s wave have carved out these valleys and kept them green. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it on Earth \ud83c\udf0f \ud83d\ude00"

We spotted this gaping hole from the sky, and our pilot was able to find a fairly flat spot for us to land nearby. \ud83d\udc4dThen we put on the crampons and hiked across a small bit of the glacier and down into the mouth of this cave. \ud83c\udfbfI\u2019m just learning about glaciers and how thick they can be, so I\u2019m not sure how far a cave like this one could go; but we were only near the mouth of it. If you look closely you can see giant boulders stuck in the ice above; this place was not particularly stable or safe, \ud83d\ude40so we were careful to watch the boulders overhead and did not stay in very long. Just long enough to enjoy something unique and wonderful! I snapped this photo as my explore mates were climbing out! Fun times :) Quite a difference from where I am now\u2026 Hawaii :) On the day I arrived I went over to the Big Island to see the lava and now I\u2019m on Lanai for the first time. Lanai has a population of just 3,000! I\u2019d always wanted to visit but never had\u2026 Been so busy taking everything in, I haven\u2019t got any photos to share, so I\u2019ll leave that for later. \ud83d\ude00\ud83e\udd19"

Thats an underwater restaurant! \ud83c\udfddI was dreaming of the Maldives warm shores the last few nights! \ud83c\udf0cI just spent some of the coldest nights of my life in a mountain village in Bhutan! Its been an eye opening trip here in the land of the Thunder Dragon\u2014I have learned to not take life\u2019s luxuries for granted: a warm, soft place to sleep; a heater or fire on a chilly night, or even a bathroom inside your house. All things I\u2019ve taken for granted since birth. No longer! I can say I\u2019m glad to have toughed it out sleeping with the same bedding as the locals, but when I come back to Bhutan I will definitely bring a sleeping bag! I\u2019ve had very little Internet here, so I can\u2019t yet upload the video for the Maldives trip giveaway, but its coming soon \ud83d\ude00"

These beautiful structures with giant walls reveal a lot about Bhutan\u2019s unique culture. First, it is a defensible fortress--a holdover from days when wars were still happening. You can\u2019t see from the picture I took here, but the walls descend further, so there\u2019s no way for attackers to climb up or get inside. There\u2019s tiny slits around the Dzong where people inside can shoot arrows at attackers on the outside! \ud83c\udff9I\u2019ve seen 10 fortresses like this in throughout Bhutan, and they\u2019re usually built on a hillside with a strategic view of the valley, and, if the view isn\u2019t so great, there\u2019s a secondary watchtower in a better position. But what are they defending? I am just learning, but there\u2019s a unique confluence of activity inside each Dzong: besides a military fortress, today, Dzong\u2019s are homes for monks, and a spiritual center, but they also house all kinds of offices\u2014think of it like the combination church, DMV, a civil court, an architecture planning office, and anything else related to the city\u2019s administration. It shows how there is a lack of separation between \u201cchurch and state\u201d\u2026 In Bhutan, their philosophical and \u201creligious\u201d beliefs (some say Buddhism is not a religion, but a philosophical perspective), are integrated with the government, not separated. \ud83c\udf8aMore Bhutanese are beginning to dress like Westerners, but when you visit the Dzong, you are required to where the traditional dress of the Bhutanese people. To foreign eyes, it makes for a colorful and exciting experience\u2014you feel like you\u2019re in the 16th century watching the activity inside, even though people might be there to get architectural plans approved, or to get a divorce, or something else that seems very \u201cmodern\u201d to us. Ah yes, and the chilis\u2026 I had to include the chilis drying in the sun. Bhutanese add chilis to almost every dish (even in their rice); certainly there will be chilis in every meal! The chilis are dried outside, typically on the roof of homes. \ud83c\udfe0 Drying can take a month! \u2600\ufe0fI think I\u2019ll be adding chilis to dishes when i get back home! \ud83d\ude00"

Lol \ud83d\ude00 I've been doing photography for about 5 years now and it's rare for me to love shots anymore--the bar always gets a little higher and it's hard to be satisfied. But this one, I love! \ud83d\ude0d I've been helicoptering around Alaska for about a week trying to shoot the incredible glaciers and mountains from the sky and the weather has been a challenge, to say the least! This moment was just that-- gone in an instant--the fog cleared to reveal the peak of the mountain for just a few seconds and after a week of trying, I finally got something! I love it so much I want to invite everyone over to see it on the big screen!! \ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude03 Not sure if this scene translates so well to the small size of instagram, but this is a giant waterfall coming off this melting glacier and we are high up in the sky. The bottom of the waterfall you see here is still several thousand feet up the mountain. Yay \ud83d\ude0a satisfied! \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc"

You don\u2019t always have to understand the path forward. It\u2019s OK to be lost at times. Crisis begets growth. In fact, some research shows that crisis is one of the few things that can really change us after age 25. If you\u2019re feeling this way, just know that things can change in a moment \u2014 a chance occurrence can change your life forever. In the meantime, fill your brain with good ideas, follow the signs that life is sending to you, be open to what\u2019s possible. If you\u2019re doing OK in life right now, give your smile and empathy to strangers and friends. We never know what someone is going through. What does all this have to do with this photo? Haha well, I suppose this photo gives me a feeling of hope and a reminder that life, despite its conflicts, is always a beautiful thing. \ud83d\ude00\ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udcf7\ud83e\udd19"

If there\u2019s any good that can come from such a shocking tragedy, maybe it\u2019s that it forces us to appreciate our loved ones more fervently? At any moment, through accident or through evil, you could lose those who gave you life, or those who you live for. That\u2019s something I normally don\u2019t even think about. \ud83d\ude15\nThis weekend, Vegas is hosting a lantern festival\u2026 I\u2019ve wanted to attend as soon as I heard about it last year. It\u2019s an awesome feeling to come together in a public space and enjoy a sense of community\u2026 It\u2019s one of the ways we feel \u201cone\u201d with everyone and everything around us.\nAnd now this\u2026 Some of my Vegas friends (I have a home in Vegas) are afraid to even go into a public space anymore. I understand\u2026 but for me, I don\u2019t want to let negative forces in the world rob me of what\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019ll be attending. I know the ceremony will take on added significance and may even act as a memorial or vigil for those who were hurt by this tragedy.\nI'm Hoping for a beautiful experience like I had the last time I went to a lantern festival\u2014taking this photo was so meaningful for me back then. This weekend will probably be even more so. Peace.\ud83c\udf0e"

Each shot is unique, and it\u2019s amazing to see the literal formation of our Earth. \ud83c\udf0e Makes ya think, now doesn\u2019t it! \ud83e\udd14Anyway, Love me some lava! \ud83d\udd25I went into zen mode at 4am this morning and processed this lava shot from the Big Island, Hawaii. It was quite difficult, but fun to manage the light in this shot\u2014adjusting, dodging and burning so its not too hot in any one area. Lava does not want to be photographed, I\u2019ll tell ya! \ud83d\udcf7The dynamic range on a shot like this \u2014 from the very bright spots areas to the darkest shadows \u2014 is very extreme, and not something the camera can handle easily. It took a bit of wrangling to get it to look like this, but I\u2019m really satisfied with the results. \ud83e\udd17 Half the fun of photography for me is turning on some music and sitting down with the computer to polish an image like this. Recently I\u2019ve been talking with a friend who\u2019s convinced me to put some of my photos in an art gallery, book and store\u2026 It\u2019s just the beginning phases, and I haven\u2019t done the work needed to prepare the photos, but I spent the time and attention on this image with that thought in mind. I\u2019d like to see this one in print :) \ud83d\udcf7\ud83c\udf05"

In You can get a stunning perspective from the sky. Here\u2019s a drone shot I took on the first day we were there. Why did I leave this paradise so soon? I was rushing back to LA because I was scheduled to record some of the first episodes of a new podcast I\u2019m working on. I went straight from 15 hours of flying (and 25 hours of traveling) to the @podcastone studio \ud83c\udfa4\ud83c\udfa5 to interview @rsdtyler This man is a dynamo, and hearing him riff on an idea or question brought to mind a quote I jotted down during my flight: \u201cWisdom is the reward you get for a lifetime of listening when you\u2019d have preferred to talk.\u201c I\u2019m working out a trip giveaway to the very resort I stayed at\u2026 I\u2019lll post details on how to win soon! \ud83d\ude00"

I would congratulate her by name, but I\u2019m not sure what her name is, I\u2019m going to slide into her DM right now! Haha.. And as for this photo, I posted it a few days ago and all you sharp shooters notice that it was in low-resolution. \ud83d\udcf7I felt so ashamed I deleted it and re-uploaded, so here you go a nice clean version! And yes, this is a real waterfall in Iceland and yes the water really is that blue!! Something about the minerals in the river create this color, I forget why\u2026 Someone smarter than me can probably tell us all? But it\u2019s truly a site to behold, just like many things in Iceland! I\u2019m thinking of doing another Iceland give away because people were so into it.. Should I, Should I?? \ud83e\udd14Let me know your thoughts\u2026 And I\u2019m about to do another Hawaiian \ud83c\udfddgiveaway as well. This time, for the Big Island - the island with the lava running into the water! \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf0bLava pouring into the ocean is one thing I think everyone should put on their bucket list!! I\u2019m going to the Hawaii tomorrow morning (and will actually meet the winner of the first contest). After a day in Oahu, I\u2019m headed to the Big Island on Friday. Hopefully I will return to Instagram with an amazing lava-entering-the-water shot!!

I\u2019d done that several times before, but not right over the Ko\u2019olau Range, and not during sunset. Wowzers! I was feeling so happy and grateful, thanks @magnum_helicopters for showing me something I\u2019d never seen before and giving me one more reason to love this place!

I\u2019m curious to hear people\u2019s reflections on how it felt to sit in that mental space for 30 minutes until it became clear it was a false alarm? I was not on the Island, and only heard about it after I knew it was not true. Today I saw death threats were being made against the worker who made the mistake. \ud83d\ude12I guess we know that a crisis always brings out the worst in people, but I bet it also brings out the best.

I think this mostly came from friends who inspired me\u2026 They know who they are. Feeling very grateful for this change, and for the people who got my creative mojo firing. Onwards and upwards! \ud83d\ude80\n\nThis shot was from yesterday\u2019s hike on Kauai! \u26f0Was moving so fast with my time-limited hiking partners that I never got a chance to take out my camera! This was shot on the iPhone 7+ and edited with built-in Apple tools and some Snapseed. After all that, I brought it into Photoshop to remove some purple noise in the shadows. Finally I made a few changes to clarity and color in IGs editor. Haha. Imagine the day when your phone camera could do everything a DSLR can do\u2026 It\u2019s really not that far away. In many ways, the phone is better \u2014 certainly for portability and also in the way it handles different layers of depth and light. I know if I shot this on my DSLR it would have been even harder for me to process to my satisfaction. Went for a more painterly feel since it was pretty noisy and easier to edit that way?? I like it a lot !! Do you like?? :-) \ud83d\ude00"

In this case, I don\u2019t think its hurting much. It just a view from a hill, and the community around it won\u2019t be bothered much by a few photographers on their mountain. But I often think about how tourism is affecting the places I love\u2026 and the role my photos are having in that ignition of tourism. \ud83e\udd14 Why am I posting it now? Well, I have a plan\u2026 it\u2019s coming together. It looks like I\u2019ll be visiting a place quite near to China. One I\u2019ve wanted to see for a long time, and for many intriguing reasons\u2026 I won\u2019t say where it is yet. But I imagine there's landscapes that look like this mystery country I'm talking about. And I think this unnamed, mysterious country (aren't you dying to know now!?) is doing special things to make sure tourism doesn\u2019t negatively impact the culture and land. Stay tuned :) \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00"

I just got back from Bhutan, a place where life feels integrated, whole, directed. About 7 years ago, I chose to live in multiple places around the world; I consider myself a member of various communities. The differences are striking. One of my favorite homes is Hawaii. \ud83c\udfddTomorrow I\u2019m going there.\ud83e\udd19Part of why I love Hawaii and why it feels like home to me is similar to the feeling I get in Bhutan. There\u2019s an attitude of calm in Hawaii. You see it in everything, from the speed of traffic, to the gait with which people walk. \ud83d\udc63In part, it\u2019s island life, but it runs deeper than geography. It\u2019s cultural and philosophical. When your community is strong, your purpose in life feels more secure. \ud83d\udc95The state of Hawaii is ranked lowest in the US for depression. \ud83d\ude00It\u2019s fifth lowest for separation and divorce. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66Is this all because of sunny weather and beautiful beaches? I don\u2019t think so. It helps, but that\u2019s not the whole story. There\u2019s a saying or hashtag you may have seen on Instagram #luckywelivehawaii To me, that simple idea reflects pride, gratitude, and wisdom, all in one concept: pride in heritage and traditions, gratitude for that heritage to exist and continue, and wisdom of those living in Hawaii to recognize the uniqueness that their heritage does exist and continue. \ud83c\udf0f\ud83d\ude0eWhen you exist in a community like that, you\u2019re less likely to suffer as an individual. If you\u2019re struggling on a personal level, sometimes the answer may lie outside yourself\u2014in a community that\u2019s waiting for you. Aloha :) \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"

What? For those that did know Bhutan, it was always for one of two things: 1) the pleasant idea that the government and King make policy decisions based on the principles of \u201cGross National Happiness\u201d and 2) the Himalayan Buddhist temple, Tiger\u2019s Nest which I\u2019ve posted here. I\u2019d seen photos of Tiger\u2019s Nest for many years, but photos do not give you a sense of just how high up it is! \ud83c\udf04\ud83d\udcf7 I\u2019d had the impression that Tiger\u2019s Nest was perched just above a city, and that you could look up and see it from a town below, sort of like the Potala Palace in Lhasa. That\u2019s not the case - not even close! You\u2019ll probably never see a photo of Tiger\u2019s Nest from the valley floor on Instagram because it would be so boring\u2014in a photo taken from the bottom, Tiger\u2019s Nest would be just a tiny speck on the mountain side. \ud83d\uddfbFor Americans or anyone who has been to Yosemite, imagine you\u2019re standing on the valley floor and looking at the very tops of the highest rock surfaces and you see a small speck that *might* be manmade. That\u2019s the best way I could relate to you how high up this special Bhutanese monastery is. To visit the viewpoint from where I took this photo, you start at a forested valley floor, and hike up several hours. \ud83d\udeb6\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fThere\u2019s no rock climbing involved, and its only steep in a few places, but the sheer length of the trek makes the existence of this place that much more remarkable. It\u2019s not just its beauty and the seemingly impossible engineering that gives you a sense of awe, it\u2019s also the idea that every piece of wood, stone, every relic and jewel housed inside, was carried up one by one. \ud83d\udcaa Pro Tip: If you decided to visit yourself, start your journey before dawn, or in the afternoon, and you\u2019re likely to have the viewpoint all to yourself. We did :) !! We were there so late, we came down in total darkness. Remember your flashlights."

I first shot lava pouring into the ocean when I started photography in 2012. I didn't realize how lucky I was to have witnessed this amazing phenomenon -- shortly after seeing it, the lava stopped flowing into the ocean and did not come back until 2016. This was taken in August. I came back to this location 4 or 5 times over several days and each time it would change dramatically. On the bottom of this photo, you can see the glowing ledge I'm standing on. When I  returned to this spot 24 hours later, the lava was flowing directly under me and the ledge was just too hot to stand on. I couldn't even last for 2 or 3 seconds to get a shot off! Truly one of those most awesome inspiring things you could see on this Earth!"

This is the Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu Crater in the Big Island\u2019s Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. \ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udfddWhat you\u2019re seeing here is the glow from a lava lake inside the crater. The level of the lava changes over time and in 2015 it actually rose above the rim you see there and spilled out for a bit! So crazy! \ud83d\ude31According to Hawaiian legendthe crater is home to Pele, the goddess of fire and volcanoes! Normally I'd check star maps \u2728and go to a place just at the right time to catch the Milky Way in the right position. This night was just luck--I went to shoot and there it was. \ud83c\udf0c\ud83c\udf0b If you want to go see this for yourself, go back a few posts to my video and enter to win the free trip to the Big Island! \ud83e\udd19\ud83d\ude00"

When I\u2019m standing in this spot, I don\u2019t think back to the battles or the lives lost. It\u2019s just a place where I love to go and feel the wind and gaze out over the beautiful island that I love so much. You can\u2019t normally go up here at night. It\u2019s closed to visitors\u2026 But at the right time of year, you can be up here as darkness falls and just as they\u2019re asking everyone to leave. That\u2019s my boy @vincelimphoto standing there\u2026 I had him remove his shirt because it was so windy, it was flapping in the wind and since it\u2019s dark, I had to shoot a longer exposure\u2026 Yah yah, just excuses for the beefcake right? I told him I\u2019d never be allowed to share the photo because his girlfriend wouldn\u2019t want all the attention he might receive, but now that he\u2019s engaged, I think he\u2019s safe\u2026 Go VINCE + JESSICA haha!!"

I've never tried viewing the lava field from a boat or plane, I've always hiked or biked out there. \ud83d\udeb2Definitely looks like something worth trying! On this morning me and @john_hook road the clunkiest 1 speed bmx bikes along the rock strewn road. Definitely not recommended! Get a good bike if you rent one! In the year since the lava started flowing into the ocean a whole swath of rental companies have set up shop! Make sure to get there before the sun comes up or until after it goes down. The glowing light is something that'll stay with you! \ud83d\udd25"

Yes you can camp in Iceland in the summer, it\u2019s really not that cold! \u2603\ufe0fThe amazing thing is not the warm temperature (did you know NYC is often colder than Iceland?), but that me and my friend were the only ones up there! \ud83d\udc91 There\u2019s so many stunning landscapes in Iceland that there\u2019s room to go around :) Haha. If you\u2019re looking for a little solitude, all it takes is going just slightly off the beaten path. It\u2019s incredible to think places like this even exist, let alone that there\u2019s no one there looking at them but you and the sheep! On my last trip, we drove just a few miles away from Seljalandsfoss (a waterfall that can be packed with tourists) and we discovered the most incredible canyon. We spent hours in it, and before going there I\u2019d never seen a single photograph from it\u2026 It was basically like being in a mini version of Oregon\u2019s Columbia River Gorge and not one person was there but us! I\u2019ll post a shot from that tomorrow :)"
