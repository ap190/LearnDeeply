Portfolio review and FaceTime interview required. 10 student limit. It\u2019s been 2 years since I\u2019ve done a workshop in PR and it\u2019s one of my favorite places to shoot and an ideal workshop location. I see so many photographers out there with a passion and yet needing to unlock their personality in a visual way. My job is to give you those keys. This workshop is for serious photographers who realize they need to lock down a look,a style, a mission. Daily critique and long shooting days are what it takes to develop a photo essay of either journalistic import or conceptual realizations. It\u2019s for those who seek commissions or simply want to publish a meaningful book. My former students are rocking it in every way, which is the ONLY real benchmark for a mentor. This is not a tour workshop. This is a hard work workshop. Not for the feint of heart. I know that pushing those I mentor to their limits just flat out works. A simple camera (or phone), good walking shoes, and an open mind is all you need. I\u2019ll help with all the rest. All work and no fun? Ha! When I work the hardest I\u2019m also having the most fun.

I\u2019ve immersed myself most especially in Trinidad/Tobago, Grenada, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. I think I could easily go from island to island and never want to leave any of them. Yet Puerto Rico brings me back most often. We will announce soon details for our photo workshop in Old San Juan in February 2019. The wind picks up and a storm rolls in as I explore here the ruins of an old fortress and lighthouse. Waves crash against cliffs just yards away. Soon it will be dark. I pop a small $20. strobe to pick up detail. Minimalist. A palm bends. My mind is nowhere else but here. Obsessed with a wall. The photographer\u2019s life."

This is a special one time only let\u2019s all get along print sale until midnight EST November 26. I made this picture when I was 22 and photographing the Liggins family in Norfolk, Va. This became my first book \u201cTell It Like It Is\u201d 1967. Freedom is what this picture says. You can\u2019t argue with this picture. Bi-partisan. Yet this moment of freedom didn\u2019t last for David Liggins riding his plywood hand made rollerskatesboard. I lived with the Liggins for a month but in the end I went back to grad school. They stayed. I\u2019m friends with the Liggins family today. 50 years since I made this photograph. Now this one-time limited edition archival pigment print made by my long time collector edition printer Michael Courvoisier. 6x9 image size on 8.5x11 museum quality paper. Signed en verso in pencil. See it NOW on my IG Stories. Prints shipped free by Dec 15. You invest $150. and 30% goes immediately to @bronxdocumentarycenter to support their efforts to aid young minds who might want to use a camera to explore the freedom photography may bring . What goes around...Our original goal with doing \u201cTell It Like It Is\u201d was to take the book profit back to the community . So too with the current version and now the print. Anyway I just dreamed up this print idea today. Ideas sometimes just POP.We must all fight negativity wherever it is. One way is to do some little thing that might help only one other person. Think small. Anyway let\u2019s all chill please. Breathe in breathe out. I wish all here a warm holiday season. Most of us really do get along most of the time. Freedom.See link in profile and help support a young photographer in the Bronx. Yes I too appreciate the support so I can keep shooting. Thank you . Link in profile \ud83c\udf88"
