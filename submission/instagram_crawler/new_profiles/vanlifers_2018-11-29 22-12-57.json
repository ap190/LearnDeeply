            "caption": "@silvervanproject\n\"I have never really been a Netflix or TV person back home, but I have to admit, that watching movies in the van (which we didn't do at all the first 4 months of our trip) brings a lot more of the \"homefeeling\". I can't really describe it, maybe it's the possibility to do what every you want or maybe watching a movie in bed, drinking a beer and eating a damn good and cheap pizza brings some special coziness? I will think about that eating the next pizza \ud83e\udd14\ud83c\udf55\ud83c\udf7b\n.\n.\n.\nWhat brings a special homefeeling to your place? What item, food, person or activity helps you feeling at home?\n.\n.\n.\n#pizza #netflixandchill #beer #vwt5 #portugal #vanlifeportugal #nature #wildcamping #travel #vanbuild #vanlife #vanlifediaries #vanlifers #vanlifeeurope #vanconversion #campervan #vwtransporter #homeiswhereyouparkit #homeonwheels #buslife #vanvibes #vancrush  #seeyouontheroad #wanderlust #vandwelling #lifeontheroad #projectvanlife #roadtrip #nomadstays #silvervanproject",
