It\u2019s in the moments, when I\u2019m reminded that I can\u2019t control, but must trust, that I find myself growing the most. \ud83c\udf31\n.\nIf you would have asked me 6 months ago where I\u2019d be today, my answer would never have been where I am now. Most things would have been different, but that\u2019s not how they happened. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n.\nYet as I write this, I find myself living a life I had never expected, feeling passionate about the environment in ways I never have before, working harder than I\u2019ve ever worked before (@findtap), but also enjoying my life more than I have in a long time. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n.\nPlans for your life are only just that: plans...and I\u2019m learning not to be so attached to how I think my life should or will look in the future. \ud83d\ude03\n.\nHere\u2019s to trust. Here\u2019s to holding the reins a little more loosely, and focusing on enjoying the ride instead. \ud83d\udc97\n.\nDo you go with the flow? Or do you white-knuckle the reins like me? \ud83d\ude48\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: @shanarehwald\nWearing: @aloyoga"

Believe it or not, it only took me about 10 minutes to write it all down. It was 1 page, front and back. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\nOnce I wrote it all down, I could see that I had simply been repeating the same thoughts in different words in my head over and over again. There weren\u2019t even as many issues to work through as it had seemed. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nMy journaling gave me perspective, released my stress, and helped me clarify my feelings...maybe there\u2019s actually something to this. \ud83d\ude09\nNow, while it\u2019s all fresh, and the feeling of freedom from my thoughts is strong, I\u2019m sharing this post to remind you that JOURNALING ROCKS! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\nIt\u2019s such a good way to clear your mind, quell anxiety, take stock of your life, feel more aware of your feelings and motivations, and more in control of your thoughts and decisions. \ud83d\udc86\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nGot an issue you\u2019re grappling with? Trust me, journal about it. You\u2019ll be glad you did. I know I am. \ud83d\udc97\nHappy Sunday. \ud83d\ude0a"

I think it\u2019s because I said \u201cno\u201d too many times to too many people, and they stopped asking. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI used to run into several people a day without even leaving, but now it\u2019s just me and my dog and my cat all day. \ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc31\nI threw myself a pity party for a few days, looked for attention from the wrong person, and then woke up and realized it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. I don\u2019t have to feel lonely or alone. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\nI may have been socially lazy before and turned into a bit of a hermit, but that\u2019s over. I\u2019m smoking less weed and being more social, 2 things I should have been doing long ago. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\nNow every time I talk to a friend, I invite them to do something with me, and let them know that even though I\u2019ve said no to a lot of invites, I\u2019m ready to say yes now. \ud83e\udd17\nIt feels weird (uncomfortable) to be so open and vulnerable, as to admit to people I admire that I\u2019m feeling lonely and need some friends, but the alternative is not one that I\u2019m okay with, so I keep opening up and reaching out. \ud83e\udd17\nIf you\u2019re feeling lost or lonely in your life, don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to the people you know, even if you haven\u2019t seen or spoken to them in what feels like an inappropriately long time, and let them know how you\u2019re feeling. They care about you, I promise. \ud83d\ude0a\nI care about you too, and I want to remind you that no matter what, you are loved, and your presence here matters! \ud83d\udc97\n.\nThanks @acrowithjon for coming over yesterday and being such a good friend. You\u2019ve been there for me in the good times, the bad times, and the weird times, and I\u2019m so grateful for you. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n.\nBoth rocking @aloyoga \ud83d\ude0a"

I worked at a clothing store, I was a cashier at a pizza shop, a receptionist at a hair salon, a yoga teacher, and for a short time, a personal assistant. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n.\nBack then I believed that the entire point of working any job, was to get to a point where I didn\u2019t have to work anymore. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n.\nMy days off were spent laying around and watching TV, generally doing as little as possible, because I thought that was the ultimate goal: being free to do nothing. \ud83d\ude34\n.\nTurns out I was so wrong. \ud83e\udd2f\n.\nFor the first time in years, in addition to my IG, I\u2019ve been spending some of my days working in, what my parents would call, a \u201creal job\u201d. \ud83d\ude31\n.\nI was always afraid of \u201creal jobs\u201d. The idea of working in an office, or a cubicle scared me. I told myself I wasn\u2019t cut out for that life. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n.\nThe shocking part is, I actually love it. This isn\u2019t your average office job, but it\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve come, and I appreciate having the chance to problem solve and work as a team with people I respect. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n.\nShowing up to work, even early in the morning, and even though it\u2019s a 2+ hr round trip almost every time, is easy in a way I never though it would be. We\u2019re Water Warriors, working to change our world for the better, and it\u2019s exciting! \ud83d\udca7\n.\nMy tv lives in a closet, just in case I ever need it, but now my days off are spent working\u2014 not because I have to, but because I want to, and THAT is everything. \ud83d\ude03\n.\nSorry that this is an old photo and I haven\u2019t been posting here as much lately, but I\u2019ve been distracted in the best possible way. I wake up with a sense of purpose everyday, and I can\u2019t wait to show you what we\u2019re up to. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n.\nWe\u2019re in stealth mode until tomorrow, but in the meantime, if you\u2019re curious, follow @findtap and stay tuned. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc97\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: @dancampbelllloyd"

This would create a scene on Runyon Canyon in LA. \ud83d\ude02\n.\nI spend so much time worrying about how I look back home (and generally feeling self-conscious). I think twice before going out without my hair and makeup done, and picking out clothing feels genuinely stressful. \ud83d\ude2c\n.\nI tend towards being a bit vain and over-concerned with appearances (it\u2019s something I work on daily), and living in LA, I feel like have to work extra hard love myself no matter what and not get sucked in to the comparison game. It doesn\u2019t always work. \ud83d\ude2c\n.\nI\u2019m starting to wonder if living in such an image-obsessed place really isn\u2019t very good for me. \ud83e\udd14\n.\nHere on Kauai, I feel confident from the moment I wake up. I rarely even have a thought about how my hair looks or what clothes I\u2019ll wear, and I quit wearing makeup usually by day 3. \ud83d\udc86\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n.\nI wore makeup on my birthday, and I laughed so hard, for so long, that it made me cry and fill my eyes with mascara. It was a reminder that I\u2019d like to laugh endlessly without worrying about my makeup (or experiencing itchy painful eyes). \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n.\nPriorities here are different. It\u2019s less about how life looks, and more about how life feels... and it feels so right. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n.\nI almost moved to Kauai instead of West Hollywood, and now I\u2019m once again questioning my decision making abilities. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n.\nI probably should have moved here instead, but I just signed a year long lease, so I\u2019ll make the best of it... and come decompress and reprioritize on Kauai as often as I can. \ud83d\ude09\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: @robinnectar"

My body/face/whatever isn\u2019t as pretty as hers. My personality isn\u2019t as bubbly as hers. I\u2019m too this. I\u2019m not enough that. \ud83e\udd2f\n.\nInstead, last night I found myself excitedly telling @aubrymarie, about a new breakthrough I had: while all those comparative observations might be facts, for the first time, none of it mattered one bit, because, much to my surprise, I\u2019m starting to finally feel it in my bones that I\u2019m enough... no matter what qualities anyone else possesses. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n.\nRather than feeling shy or insecure, I feel like I showed up as myself this weekend, in all of my flawed yet perfect glory, and I HAD A BLAST. \ud83d\ude03\n.\nUnlike last year, when I shyly avoided people I didn\u2019t already know well, I made new friends and realized I had missed out on connecting with a lot of epic people last year, because of my own insecurities. \ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n.\nI was nervous and a little intimidated going into the weekend, but I ended up surprising myself and connecting with 100+ yogis, who, each in their own right, are some of the most inspiring people that I have the pleasure to call my friends. \ud83e\udd17\n.\nI know my insecurities will keep surfacing, and that my self work is far from done, but I think it\u2019s important to be grateful for the moments, when you have a chance to realize that all that challenging self work you\u2019ve been doing, is actually having a noticeable impact. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc97"
