She doesn't like people who yell in the street or invade her space to get a closer look at her, or loud trucks or horns. I think she likes the diversity & action of the city but not the noise & disruption. Me too lol. Can't blame her. Soon we go to nature. Adventures await!",

      "description": "Because it's Monday I present to you my Pizza Hut uniform. One of my high school jobs.\n🍕\nI also taught dance since age 9. I proposed an adult beginner class for the moms. Loved teaching that too.\n👯\nI also sold blow pops out of my locker (on the side). My Dad is still annoyed he had to start filing taxes for me at age 9.\n🌈\nI just love to be productive & be around people & try to help in some way, whether that is folding Pizza boxes to make sure the staff doesn't panic during the dinner rush or asking someone how they are when they walk into @stralayoga nothing much has changed.\n🌿\nI strived for a life of freedom then & now. Doesn't matter what your job is, how you are radiates through others & back to you. Cultivate good vibes & you can have just as much fun bringing someone a refill as giving a talk on stage to thousands. I've done both & one can be as exciting as the other.\n🦋\nIf you are frustrated at where you are now you will be frustrated even if you get where you think you want to go. 😊\nHow you are in one thing is how you are in anything.\n🌱\nI do miss those days when the Pizza Hut manager would flip when it got too busy & I would run around & find little things to do to make everyone's job easier & the customers happy. Loved doing whatever needed to be done, even if it wasn't my \"job.\" My job is to always do whatever I can to make the atmosphere harmonious. A customer once wanted some soda we didn't carry & I ran out to the gas station across the street to get it. I folded all the boxes when I got to work to prepare for the day. Manager thought I was OCD (boxes everywhere) until rush hit & we never ran out. Ha! Love that little stuff.\n🌸\nLeadership is all about creating flow. More on this in my new book, Guiding Strala. And yes, working at Pizza Hut has big life lessons.\n🙈\nP.S. my mom held onto this & all of my old stuff for when \"I got famous\" she always said I was such a ham & always needed to achieve so if you want strips of my childhood bedroom wallpaper I can hook you up with her.\n🍕\n😳\n🌿\n#stralayoga #guidingstrala #lesdership #leadership",

      "description": "I can't believe my little babe is 2 months old & I'll be back in this gorgeous space leading classes & programs soon.\n💫\nThis Saturday if you reserved a space for 11am ENERGIZE don't forget to come 😉 we'll send out reminder emails this week but you signed up way in advance 🙏🏼 and it's finally here. If you didn't get a space and would have liked to join (sorry this one filled up pretty fast) we have another class / party for Guiding Strala book 📚 launch June 3 (still some space) our Intensive May 20-21 (a bit of space) & 300 hour Advanced Leadership Course this July (some room, get in touch about qualifying for this program)\n💫\nAnd there is Chicago Intensive June 24-25 & then off to Europe this fall, London Intensive Sept 9-10 (a couple spaces left) & 200 hour Ready-to-Lead in Amsterdam (a few spots for this one) working on a little thing for Paris while we are there for the launch of Strala Yoga in France & then there is 2018 already up for registration. Wo. Can't wait to see you all and for you to meet Daisy. I hope this lady likes to travel.\n💫\nFor our NYC friends, some of you know us mostly as a yoga studio with daily classes, and are kind of shocked when we have so many international friends and Strala Guides visiting all the time. Literally each class could be the beginning of a bar joke. A German, a French gal a group of Japanese people and a Rabbi walked into Strala. . .#yogaeverydamnday.\n💫\nLeading daily classes & running a regular yoga studio has been amazing (especially the vibrant community here in NYC, you are fun to sweat & breathe deep with) We all strive to follow how we feel & it's been wonderful to transition to using our studio & next door office to host you for special events & workshops & trainings. I love having the open space for planning programs, making videos for you and running around in our underwear singing in between flights (kidding kind of)\n💫\nLet us know any requests for classes, workshops or programs. It feels wonderful to have an open space for strala and plenty of room left for creativity.\n💫\nGo after what gives you goosebumps.\n💫\nMy door is always open. See you soon.\n.\n.\n.\n#stralayoga #guidingstrala #nycyoga #yogatraining #taichi",
