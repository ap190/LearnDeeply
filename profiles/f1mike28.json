This fabulous supercar is ready to display its character in total purity and freedom. Inspired to the F version, this extreme supercar that features a longer wheelbase was created specifically to meet a client‚Äô request. It embodies dedicated engineering know how that represents the outcome of the maximum expression of aesthetic, aerodynamic and ergonomic research.\n\nNew heart, new guise\nThe central monocoque in carbon-titanium, more rigid and lighter than ever, encases a Mercedes-AMG M120 V12 6.0L high-performance racing engine as if it were a precious gem. This four wheel prodigy is able to deliver 750HP and produce a torque of 710Nm. This engine is bolted directly to the central monocoque. A direct throttle actuation via mechanical cable ensures immediate throttle response, thus achieving improved propulsor performance in terms of reactivity.\n\n20 milliseconds is the time needed by the Zonda R to perform gearshifts, thanks to a transversal sequential gearbox in magnesium, enhanced by the Xtrac transmission technology.\n\n0-100 in less than 2.7 seconds. A power-to-weight ratio of 701 hp-per-ton combined with Pirelli Pzero tyres can catapult the driver from 0 to 100 km/h in less than 2,7 seconds, while the Brembo carbon ceramic brakes ensure the car comes to a standstill even quicker.\n\nA dry weight of 1.070 kg is achieved through the AvionAl suspension components, Aspa machined structural ErgAl parts holding the engine and the gearbox, and Poggipolini Titanium screws. Moreover, aerodynamic setups allows for a high downforce setting of up to 1.500kg and a 350km/h top speed setting.\n\nThe Pagani Zonda R powered by the Mercedes-AMG M120 V12 engine 6.0L 750HP and 710Nm of Torque.

Driven By The Inner Force.\n\nWith the AMG GT C Roadster, Mercedes-AMG is introducing a further output level of the 4.0L V8 Biturbo, thereby underlining the exclusive character of the new model. At 557hp the peak output is 47hp above that of the AMG GT S and 28hp below the Mercedes-AMG GT R. The maximum torque of 680Nm is available from 1900 to 5750 rpm.

Maximum torque attains a new best value of 900Nm. It is available over a broad engine speed range of 2750 to 4500rpm and so provides a feeling of effortless superiority in every accelerator pedal position. A sprint from zero to 100 km/h is absolved in 3.5 seconds, and this dynamic acceleration only ends at the governed top speed of 250km/h (with AMG Driver's package: 300km/h).\nThe advanced AMG 4.0L V8 biturbo engine utilises well-proven twin turbocharging, with the two chargers not located outside on the cylinder banks, but rather between them in the V of the cylinders. The advantages of the \"hot inner V\" are a compact engine design, an immediate response from the twin-scroll turbochargers and low exhaust gas emissions thanks to optimum air flow for the close-coupled catalytic converters. \nTwo twin-scroll turbochargers are deployed for the first time to boost performance and improve responsiveness further. The housing is divided into two parallel flow passages. Combined with two separate exhaust ducts in the exhaust manifold, this makes it possible to control the exhaust gases on the turbine wheel separately. The exhaust gas from the first and fourth cylinders of the cylinder bank is fed into one duct and exhaust gas from the second and third cylinders to the other duct. The aim is to prevent the individual cylinders from having mutually adverse effects on the gas cycle.\nThe results are increased output due to improved cylinder charge with fresh mixture, more torque at low revs and very immediate response times.\n\nMercedes-AMG One man, one engine Handcrafted by Michael K√ºbler @f1mike28 in Germany Affalterbach.\nDriving Performance is my Passion!

With the new Mercedes-Maybach G650 Landaulet, the off-road classic¬†demonstrates that the definition of unique luxury can always be taken to a new level. Not only that: it¬†is forever reinventing itself and providing yet more evidence of the potential that still resides in this classic all-terrain vehicle today, which has been in production since 1979.\n\nMasterpiece of automotive engineering.\nWith its superlative V12 engine, portal axles, electric fabric top and exclusive equipment specification in the rear compartment, this very special all-terrain vehicle, which is limited to 99 units, meets the expectations of customers who demand the very highest standards of their vehicle. After the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class and the S650 Cabriolet, the open-top G-Class is the first off-roader from the Mercedes-Maybach sub-brand.\nUltimate in automotive power.\nAs is customary with the off-road icon, the ‚ÄúG‚Äù is forever breaking new ground: unlike previous Landaulets, which were based on prestigious saloons, the Mercedes-Maybach G650 Landaulet also has what it takes to deliver an unforgettable off-road experience. Familiar from the G63 AMG6√ó6 and G500 4√ó4, the portal axles provide ample ground clearance of 450 millimetres, allowing the open-top all-terrain vehicle to overcome even extreme obstacles in a masterly fashion. High drive comfort comes courtesy of the most powerful available engine, the Mercedes-AMG V12 biturbo, which delivers a maximum output of 463kW (630hp) with a peak torque of 1000Nm.\nMercedes-Maybach G650 Landaulet powered by the incredible Mercedes-AMG M279 V12 biturbo engine 6.0L 630HP and 1000Nm of Torque.

      "description": "The new AMG GT S \"The Game Changer\".\nAffalterbach. Mercedes-AMG celebrates its 50th¬†anniversary in 2017. To the theme of \"50 Years of Driving Performance\", the sports car and performance brand is marking the occasion by extending the AMG GT family of sports cars with the new Mercedes-AMG GT¬†C. Hence, the AMG GT¬†C Roadster will now be joined by a Coup√© version of the same model line. Positioned between AMG GT¬†S and AMG GT¬†R, the new vehicle will initially be available exclusively as a special Edition¬†50 model. At the same time, the Mercedes-AMG GT and AMG GT¬†S are being visually and technically upgraded while receiving even more power.\n\nNew output variants: the AMG 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine\nMercedes-AMG is restructuring the range of output/torque variants of the 4.0‚Äëlitre V8 biturbo engine. Hence, the AMG GT entry-level model now puts out 350kW (476hp), i.e. 10kW (14hp) more than before. In addition, with 630Nm, the basic version of the eight-cylinder machine now delivers an extra 30Nm of peak torque for even greater tractive power. The same figures will apply to the GT Roadster from its market launch.\nThe output from the GT S grows by 9kW (12hp) to 384kW (522hp), with the peak torque climbing 20Nm to 670Nm.\nThe next level is marked by the C variants of the Coup√© and Roadster with 410kW (557hp) and 680Nm peak torque. The top of the line is the AMG GT¬†R with 430kW (585hp) and 700Nm of torque.\nMercedes-AMG One man, one engine Handcrafted by Michael K√ºbler @f1mike28 in Germany Affalterbach.\nDriving Performance is my Passion!

When acceleration stops being a physical quanity and turns into a key stimulus for the release of fireworks in your brain. When the grip is not grip anymore but a confession of faith in the road.
