Well now I'm an #esports team owner joining 7 teams who have been leading the way growing esports in Australia. It is an exciting step I'm looking forward to the challenge and helping the OPL grow on and off the pitch/court/field/map. I clearly don't have all my esports terms down but super excited to what my team can bring.\n\nFull details at SportsGeekHQ.com or head to NewOPLTeam.com.au to join the fun",
