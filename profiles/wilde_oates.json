      "description": "Been wanting to get out to Bass Rock for so long and finally got to do it today, thankfully in calm weather (despite the clouds). Brilliant trip and such a fascinating place to see sealife up close. And I didn't puke! Definitely worth doing if you get the chance, and North Berwick is a really fun place to visit anyway (especially @steampunkcoffee). Thanks to @seabirdcentre for hosting us.\n\n#edinburgh #igersedinburgh @igersedinburgh #seabirddays",
