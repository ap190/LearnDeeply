I was fortunate enough to spend 6 years working with Leonard on and off before his death.  I was endlessly inspired by his simple way of life and incredible vision and the unrivaled art environment he built.  His message with this place was simple: \"God is Love, Love is Universal.\" I return to the mountain every chance I get when I am in Southern California.  Tomorrow I'll be at the mountain and traveling around nearby #SlabCity and the Salton Sea with my son @hawkeyehuey.  We will be sharing our photos and videos and some live video in @NatGeo's Instagram stories throughout the day.  Come join us!",

      "description": "Friends!  My non-profit  @AmplifierFoundation​  just launched a project on Kickstarter that I wanted to share with you.  It was my way of turning my fear and sadness after Nov 8th into action.  Link in my header.\n-------------------------------\nEight years ago my friend Shepard Fairey​ (@obeygiant) made an image that defined a period of HOPE in America. Today we are in very different times. In the wake of this year’s presidential campaign, very concerning things are becoming normalized:  anti-Immigrant rhetoric, building walls, mass deportations, talk of Muslim registries. This moment calls for new images, images to disrupt the rising tide of hate speech and fear mongering. We the People need to come together under a new symbol of Hope— one that reminds us that OUR America is one of equal humanity, and does not demean or discriminate. We need you to help us take back this narrative. \nIn addition to Shepard we have 2 of the most talented activist artist working today: @ernestoyerena  and @jessicasabogal.  Together these 3 artists are helping shape the American story we SHOULD be telling.\n\nThe sale of these artist's prints on Kickstarter will fund the publication of their images and words as full page ads in the Washington Post on Inauguration Day, to be distributed to 600,000 people. Free speech in public spaces has rarely been as stifled as it will be for this inauguration. But no administration can tell you can't buy a newspaper and hold it up above your head!  Beyond the ads in the Post @AmplifierFoundation will also be distributing all of these images at Metro stops, out the back of moving vans, and at drop spots in DC to be announced in the coming weeks on their site. We don’t have any one easy solution, but we do know this: We are Resilient, we must be Indivisible, we must be #GreaterThanFear, we must #DefendDignity, and we must #ProtectEachOther.  Art made from a photo by @ari.mejorado!",

      "description": "Friends!  I forgot to tell you!  @outsiderbooks is having an Aaron Huey birthday special (Im 41 today!) My #LeonardKnight #SalvationMountain book (a museum in a box filled with dime-store photos, foldouts, a song book, oral histories and postcards), was $70 but is now, for today only, $30 (link in my header). The message in that book has never been more needed then it is right now.  Leonard seemed to be able to unite all people, from every faith, race, and political party, with his kindness and LOVE.  Man, I miss this guy. (Photo by @chetbabyplays)",
