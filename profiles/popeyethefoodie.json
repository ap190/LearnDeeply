How overweight are his humans and what are their cholesterol levels?\nJust a lil bit overweight.  Momma's cholesterol level is normal, papa is a lil higher than normal.\n10.  Are his ears always like that?\n90% of the time. If he concentrates hard enough, both go up.\n11.  What camera do you use for his pics?\niPhone camera.\n12.  What is his favorite human food?\nWe think it's McDonald's chicken nuggets as it's the one item he gets super excited about.\n13.  Do you do meet ups?\nIt‚Äôs very difficult for us to do one on one meet ups, but we‚Äôve done one group meet and greet that was great fun and are hoping to do more in the future.\n14.  Does he get recognized a lot?\nHere and there.  If you see him, please feel free to say hi, and we‚Äôre totally fine with pictures.  Just look for the floppy ears or the loud, screechy ear piercing bark. \n15.  Are you ever going to visit other cities? \nWould love to travel more with him, but he didn‚Äôt do too well on our one hour flight to San Francisco.  However, we‚Äôre planning on visiting San Francisco again soon, and will try again.  If he does well on this flight, we‚Äôll try to visit other cities with him and more #popeyetravels.\n16.  How did you come up with his account idea?\nWe already enjoy taking food pics and when we realized how well behaved he was around food, we came up with his account idea. We wanted something different, fun and light hearted. We thought anyone can be a foodie, why not this lil guy? üòâ .\n.\nThanks again! üíû",

      "description": "Happy as pie! @thepieholela .\n250k?! ü§óthank you so much!!! So grateful for all the love.  Since the humans are incapable of responding to all the comments and questions, it's probably a good time to answer some common questions, again. \n1.  What breed is Popeye?\nWe know he's a mixed breed, but no one knows for certain what mix. Some guesses are pomapoo or Pom yorkie. He's 11.5 lbs and neutered. We are aware of DNA tests, but we're fine with him being a mystery mutt.\n2.  How old is Popeye?\nWe think he's about 4-5 years old.\n3.  Where did you adopt him?\nWe found him as a stray over three years ago. He was only 7 lbs when we found him. üò¢ Could not find his previous owners and at the time, couldn't find him new owners.\n4.  Does he get to eat?\nWe feed him bits of anything that is safe for him.  We also carry his favorite snacks.\n5.  How do you get him to sit in front of food without lunging at it? Did you train him?\nNo training, although he desperately needs some training on being around unfamiliar dogs and he loves hearing himself bark.  However, he's always been well behaved around food. Those who have been around us during photos will know that he just doesn't seem to care about the food. He's more interested in his dog snacks we use to capture his attention (pro tip!) He‚Äôs a strange pup and this behavior allows us to do what we do. \n6.  Where do you get his clothes and accessories?\nAnywhere, from Amazon, @themaxbone, to other online shops. We try to tag the store or brand in each pic since we get asked often.\n7.  Is he a service dog? Nope. We look for restaurants with a pet friendly patio (#petfriendlydining).\nHe has attended some media events where he was indoor.  We also like to keep him in his pet carrier (we have a few - @misopup @lovethybeast @wagwear).\n8.  Do the humans work?\nYes, we have our own jobs, including a family restaurant, @dipsgrill in Alhambra. üòâ \nMore FAQs tomorrow!\n\nThanks again and we hope you continue to enjoy his food adventures as much as we enjoy going on them. üòä üê∂ puppy cuddles for all! \n#popeyethefoodie #petfriendlydining",
