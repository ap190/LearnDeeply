      "description": "Been off my bulk for about 3 weeks now!! Ahhhh it feels so good to be back in my old routine again!!! Ending bulk weight was 142lbs - Macros are back to normal and cardio is now back into my life. I can't wait for a few more weeks to pass! Don't forget; your fitness goals are like planting a flower from a little tiny seed.. You've gotta water it everyday and for a long time you might not see anything happen.. but if you stay consistent and keep watering it everyday over time.. a beautiful flower will eventually grow aka with consistency your results will at some point happen. I thrive off of setting goals and staying consistent to accomplish them.. I know that results don't happen overnight and it takes daily consistency but as \"boring\" as it may seem, I have learned to enjoy the process of consistency to achieve them. I am happy with myself as I lay my head down on my pillow at night knowing I gave my goals that day my all. Always remember that it's not what you do \"once in a while\" that shapes your life.\nIt's what you do consistently!\n-\nAlso, I will be randomly featuring 4 people on my page tomorrow that reposts any of my pictures on their page! All you have todo is hashtag me so I can find you. #PaigeHathaway",
