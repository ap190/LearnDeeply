Thanks to gvsi for the orginal part of this dataset. We have built upon this dataset by implementing a webscrapper
for Instagram using Selenium. 

Note: Instagram regenerates image urls, so we had to write a script to regenerate stale URLs for the dataset of posts 
we took from gvsi. We also dropped posts that no longer exist, and files for users that no longer exist. The original dataset 
now consists of 15178 images.
