        "description": "Photo by @TimLaman.  Costa’s Hummingbird female feeding baby in her nest, photographed yesterday in the Palm Springs Airport.  Yes, that’s right, IN the airport, which is largely open air.  I don’t usually get my wildlife photography tips from United Airlines staff, but at check-in, when I was asked about all my gear and mentioned I was a wildlife photographer, a helpful agent told me of a hummingbird nest in a cactus on the way to my gate.  Score one point for UA!  Sure enough, there it was, and it just required a 15 min wait for the female to arrive for a feeding session.  I was glad that though I have to check a lot of my gear, I always have a core set of equipment in my carry-on so that in case I arrive somewhere and my luggage is delayed I can start shooting.  The ironic thing is that for the past several days shooting birds in the wild, I’d been hoping to find an active hummingbird nest without success…. until the airport.  Mommy hummingbird looked like she was just pumping nectar into baby.  Pretty cool.  To give you a sense of the size of these tiny birds, if I put a US Quarter coin in there, I could cover the baby with it.  #PalmSprings, #Hummingbird, @thephotosociety, @natgeocreative.",

I’ve been in the field these recent weeks pursuing the critically endangered Helmeted Hornbill for @NatGeo with @DrewFulton and the team from the Thailand Hornbill Project. Sometimes in wildlife photography, you don’t get what you are after, but some other nice opportunities arise.  I was hoping for Helmeted’s to come to this fig, and spent several mornings in a blind in the canopy, but this Rhinoceros Hornbill showed up instead!  Can’t complain – one of the most awesome birds of SE Asia.  Still frame from RED Epic-W camera.  #Hornbill, #Thailand, #rainforest, @thephotosociety, @natgeocreative, @reddigitalcinema,  #ShotonRED.",

        "description": "Here is our little baby 😍 her name is Royce, she is a siberian husky of 2 month. We think she is mixed with a malamute but we're not sure, Royce was on a place not really legit.. They told us she was vaccinated and dewormed, we believed it since we didnt know anything about dogs, its our first one, but that day we didnt take her since we are only getting our new condo on may 25. Than my friend taught me that if she was vaccinated and dewormed, she should have a health book but the guy was like \"she doesnt have it, we did the vaccine ourselves...\" we called a vet and she said it is impossible, it would be possible if they were a vet but she still would have a health book. We asked many questions to the guy, the place where she was staying was a really dirty and small appartment, the guy NEVER answered our questions, he also lied to us (you will see the complete history in our next vlogs). I couldnt believe it. I was so sad for her caus she is so beautiful and if a baby puppy don't get her vaccine and is not dewormed it can literally die, it will suffer alot. We didnt want people like us who doesnt know anything to adopt her and never be warned, and then Royce would have suffer from it and also might have bring diseases to other animals.. we went directly take her, I brought her to my parents house and they accepted her, she will be in her new house with her parents (jonathan and I) on may 25 ❤️ we will be a lovely family, and then she will also have a little sister or brother, we dont know yet 💕 so this is how our family starts, hope you are not sad it's not a baby, anyway how can you be sad while looking at Royce 🙊 We are living our life steps by steps, i need to finish my university before having a human baby, but for now we have this little baby and we are more than happy to be its parents 🙏🏽",

I used to look at myself and hope to have those caracteristics, probably some of you still do but I wanted to make you realise something I realised : I have big cheeks, Claudia tihan doesnt have the \"perfect\" smile, savannah montano has a \"big\" nose, alexis ren doesn't have the \"perfect\" eyebrows, ariana grande has small eyes, etc etc , I could name so many girls like that. If you see this as  insults, you just don't understand what I am trying to say. I want you to realise that this is the girls you (me include) look up to, they are all perfect to me and probably to you too even if they don't have all of those caracteristics so why can't you be ? The thing those girls have is : CONFIDENCE ! Confidence is the key, getting all of these caracteristic wont make you more beautiful but being confident will, trust me ✨ I read something from a girl on instagram yesterday, she will recognize herself, and it made me think about me before I realized that so I was not the only one thinking like that so I made her realize who she is and what she worth and now I want all of you to realize it 🙏🏽",

        "description": "\"Ci sono le Donne. E poi ci sono le Donne Donne. E quelle non devi provare a capirle, sarebbe una battaglia persa in partenza. Le devi prendere e basta. Devi prenderle e baciarle, e non dare loro il tempo di pensare. Devi spazzare via, con un abbraccio che toglie il fiato, quelle paure che ti sapranno confidare una volta sola, una soltanto, a bassa, bassissima voce. Perché si vergognano delle proprie debolezze e, dopo avertele raccontate, si tormenteranno - in un'agonia lenta e silenziosa - al pensiero che, scoprendo il fianco, e mostrandosi umane e fragili e bisognose per un piccolo fottutissimo attimo, vedranno le tue spalle voltarsi ed tuoi passi allontanarsi. Perciò prendile e amale. Amale vestite, che a spogliarsi son brave tutte. Amale indifese e senza trucco, perché non sai quanto gli occhi di una donna possano trovare scudo dietro un velo di mascara. Amale addormentate, un po’ ammaccate quando il sonno le stropiccia. Amale sapendo che non ne hanno bisogno: sanno bastare a sé stesse. Ma, appunto per questo, sapranno amare te come nessuna prima di loro.”",

        "description": "So today I uploaded my first ever YouTube video! The link is in my bio if you want to go watch it! Please give it a thumbs up if you do and subscribe to my channel for a weekly video.\n\nIt was a lot harder for me to film than I had anticipated. I have always known I was camera shy but never the full extent of it because I hadn't forced myself to do something. I have always wanted to have a YouTube channel and I'm so happy I finally! I hope you like it and I'll be uploading a new video next Monday if all goes well! 💕😚",

They only get better with age. So for those of our fans who have exceptional taste (all of you) and an appreciation for an open-air luxury driving experience (again, all of you), this could be your car. The 1989 Mercedes 560SL Roadster offered here is a wonderful example of the final year of R107 production and comes equipped with the highly desirable and larger 5.6-liter engine that was only sold in the US, Canada, Japan, and Australia. It also has both hard and soft tops, impeccable tan leather interior and alloy wheels. However, here’s the best part: it only has 31,000 miles and you can maybe afford it.

Raise you paddles 🙋‍♂️ or 🙅‍♂️\n_____________________________________________\n🚘 1987 Lamborghini Countach 5000 QV\n💯 One of only two built with gold interior trim\n📰 @RMSothebys Villa Erba Sale\n📸 @dirk.de.jager\n💵 Estimate: TBA\n📚 This Lamborghini Countach is as good as gold. Literally! Finished new in white over a white leather interior, the car was outfitted with much of its interior trim gold-plated, including the steering column, gated gear shifter and gate, instrument cluster, trunk and engine handles, door sills, and even the exterior badging, as well as exhaust pipe tips. Lamborghini has confirmed that this is one of just two Countaches to ever leave the factory equipped with such eye-catching 80’s opulence. This car was originally delivered to the United States (probably to someone who picked it up wearing a white linen suit and pink V-Neck T-shirt). It was then imported to Japan before eventually being acquired by its current Dutch owner and sent to Lamborghini Polo history for restoration. The car comes complete with all receipts and a certificate from Lamborghini's Polo Historical department confirming the restoration and authenticity of this rare Countach 😎\n_______________________________________________\n#auto #instacar #carporn #autoporn #design #automotive #vintage #drive #classic #classiccar #collect #icon #classiccarchasers #carphotography #forsale #drivetastefully #lamborghini #lambo #countach #modernclassic #italy #japan #usa #dutch #iconic #1980s",

Chrysler Corporation’s limited-edition 1970 Plymouth Superbird was created as its alter ego to the highly successful Dodge Daytona introduced the previous year. Of course, total dominance on NASCAR’s superspeedways was the prime objective, which the Plymouth Superbird did so magnificently with the likes of “The King” Richard Petty, Pete Hamilton and other NASCAR stars behind the wheel of these magnificent creations. The feats of these distinctive cars have become legendary over the years; they seemed to embody the term “unfair advantage” so much so that they were eventually outlawed by the powers that be at NASCAR, but not before the memory of the Winged Warriors was seared indelibly into the minds of stock-car racing fans for years to come. The real winners were those dedicated Mopar enthusiasts who bought the homologation, or street version of these cars, and managed to hold onto them. The Superbird has far exceeded anything it did in racing as a collectible car; it is as sought after today as it has ever been 😎\n_______________________________________________\n#auto #instacar #carporn #autoporn #design #automotive #vintage #drive #classic #classiccar#collect #icon #classiccarchasers #carphotography #forsale #drivetastefully #plymouth #NASCAR #musclecar #america #americanmuscle",

And the car offered here is one of a pair ordered from the factory by two Swiss brothers who must have also thought the same. This estate car originally left the factory as standard left-hand drive V8 in July of 1996 only to return to the factory 2 months later to be modified as a shooting brake. This car's color scheme is British Racing Green with matching upholstery and carpets to the interior, which also features plentiful walnut embellishment. In 1999 this example's engine was rebuilt by the factory and then sold to its second owner, a French art collector who loved and cared for the car until his passing. It was then sold at an auction in Paris in 2014 and has formed part of a significant private collection of Aston Martins. The car comes complete with owner's manual, service book, all tools, jack, first aid kit, battery conditioner, fitted car cover and, most importantly, a fitted humidor! Yes, you read that correctly.

        "description": "Family love🌙❤ This weeks podcast is out NOW! In this episode of From The Heart I talk about the challenge of being a new mom. We dive into motherhood-guilt, feeling inadequate, panicking over the smallest things and the challenge of learning how to sit with pain (any kind of pain!) even when it's unbearable. Listen in and hear about the night I literally lost my mind because the baby wouldn't stop crying and I ended up eating everything with sugar in the house, almost downing a bottle of wine (barely managed to contain myself there) and ending up binge shopping online for $700 not even remembering what I had bought the next day. Yea. Having a newborn is no walk in the park🙈 \nIn this weeks episode I share how I've moved through the most difficult days, the love that floods through it all and my realization that everything, absolutely everything, is a spiritual lesson. Tune in now! Link to iTunes in bio or go to rachelbrathen.com for all podcast providers❤ Don't forget to subscribe and leave a review! #yogagirlpodcast #fromtheheart #motherhood",

        "description": "Bought a new phone. 7+. It's ginormous and impossible to maneuver with just one hand - I don't know what I was thinking. I do everything with one hand these days. \nI was excited to share with you guys today that we've had five consecutive awesome nights: @loving.lealuna has stopped crying! We really only had three crappy nights but they were so awful they scarred me. I told @dennisfromsalad when we get to 10 consecutive days of calm we can start doing things in the evenings like normal people again but for now we are on a strict schedule. I read all the comments I receive here on IG - when I ask for advice it's because I really need it! One of the things that people kept recommending was implementing a solid evening routine (which we of course had never done because we hardly know what the word means)🙈 We now have a super routine going and it's WORKING! I guess babies need stability and calm? Who knew! Ha. Anyway. Every evening we now:\n1. Go for a walk with the dogs or go to the beach \n2. Go home and take a bath/shower. Showering with her is the highlight of my day (and no of course I would never drop her don't even mention it!). I diffuse essential oils and make the bathroom super cozy and we go in the rainfall shower together. It's the BEST. The best. She loves the water. \n3. Baby massage. With oil! She's such a little princess.\n4. PJ's\n5. Eat.\n6. SLEEP.\n\nIt's really working! Since we started the super routine we have had no crying and last night she slept for six straight hours. So I was all excited to share our progress but then of course tonight she started crying and just wouldn't stop. Yup. I'm a little less panicked about it now but it's still the most awful thing. She's asleep now but won't let me put her down and won't let Dennis take her so we are stuck together like Velcro. The best Velcro, but still🙃 \nBeing a mom is hard. And so fucking awesome! The difficult stuff is still all ok and every day I fall more in love. \nPS wrote this on my new phone with one hand💁🏼💪🏼 #boss #momlife #love",

        "description": "I'm craving yoga right now in a way that I haven't in years. It reminds me of my first year of practice and how I'd go to sleep every night, giddy with anticipation knowing I'd get to roll out my mat the moment I'd wake up. Every day was like Christmas morning. That feeling of excitement lasted about a year before routine took over and yoga became part of my normal. I turned my yoga practice into teaching and teaching into a career and along the way, I stopped feeling like I was unwrapping a gift every time I'd begin a practice. Yoga stayed important but it stopped feeling like Christmas. Until now. I had a baby and in a way I get to start from scratch -I get to be a beginner again. I've been given the gift to get to know my body once more. It's different now, compared to a decade ago. Then I was 20 pounds lighter and my body was lean and fit and strong without ever having to try. I was all sharp angles and muscle and learning how to invert and balance on my hands. My practice was like my body: firm and determined. \nNow... My body is soft. Soft, in the most beautiful way. It's like I have an extra layer of insulation now and its cushioning me from the roughness of the world; I had a baby and babies need soft things. So my body has adapted. Where there were once edges there are now round hips and thighs and in my practice, everything is different. I'm moving from a new place and even though the feeling is the same - I'm giddy with excitement to get on my mat - I'm getting to know a different body. This body is a body that's lived. It's a body that's birthed. Its a body that's carried the weight of pain and the lightness of joy and everything in between. It's a body that's busy nursing a child! It doesn't care much about balancing upside down anymore because for the first time... The world is right side up. Lea Luna is here and the love she brought has made its way into every inch of who I am. There is nothing left to prove. So this body doesn't need to be strengthened or contorted or fixed or altered anymore - it just needs to move the way it longs to move. It just needs to be. \nToday... I bow to the immeasurable beauty of my own skin. I hope you do the same.",

        "description": "First \"yoga photo\" since giving birth! I took my first class yesterday morning and realized my body feels like a total stranger. It's been so long since I thought about me or did anything for myself - all I think about is her. I've lost myself a little bit. I'm sure it's totally normal but yesterday as I awkwardly moved my body from pose to pose, trying to remember how to breathe, it hit me: I need to come back home to my body. I need to feel my feet on the ground again. Right now I don't and it makes the hard times so much harder. \nTonight started off in a similar way with Luna, clock strikes 6 and she starts crying. We had ordered take-out and decided to try putting her in the car to pick it up as the car normally calms her and puts her to sleep in an instant (yes we have officially become those kinds of parents oh god) but she cried the whole way. It's so awful. She cries and then I cry, I just lose myself in her pain. Makes me feel so helpless. We got home and she fell asleep and has been sleeping quietly since. All is well but I feel completely stressed out. Dennis says I feel everything so much more intensely these days - she cried for 30 minutes total tonight but to me it feels like 30 years. I can sense it now, how connected my inability to cope is with my feeling of disconnect with my own body. I've had 42 weeks of pregnancy, a 24-hour labor and 6 weeks of no sleep. No wonder my body feels like a stranger!\n\nSo. The Conclusion? I think it's about time I got back to #yogaeverydamnday 💪🏼🌙",

        "description": "I'm not posting much lately because I'm EXHAUSTED. This little baby girl is an absolute darling in the daytime - she spends all day laughing and smiling and cooing and talking and sleeps for 4-hour stretches and is just the dreamiest little angel ever. BUT. When the clock strikes 6pm she transforms into a tiny little terrorist holding us hostage with non-stop crying and screaming. It's like she is torturing us for information and I want to give it up I do - I just don't know what it is that she wants! It's starting to drive me slightly insane🙈 Is stomach ache that only shows up at a certain hour a thing? Or is it the transition from day to night? I have no clue what's going on. Even though she's well fed and has a fresh diaper and we've tried absolutely everything she is just so unhappy and it's the same thing every evening, going on five days now. She's never really cried for anything before so it's quite the shock for us (have we just been unusually lucky up until now and this is totally normal??). The only thing that works is bouncing her incessantly up and down, pacing around the house singing and shushing and praying to all the baby gods to help her fall asleep. Finally after hours of walking with her, right as I think my arms are literally going to fall off, she falls asleep but on top of my chest and no way in hell I'll risk transferring her to the bed by then - too risky. So basically from 6pm and for the rest of the entire night I'm holding this little girl trying to understand what's going on. We finally fall asleep but I feel like a zombie, half awake the whole night. Then all of a sudden it's 8am and she wakes up laughing - laughing! Like the hostage situation of the night before just never happened. And I look at her little face and she's just so damn perfect and adorable I forget all about it too. SOMEONE SEND HELP!😩 Or give me some advice! I love her so much it hurts me physically when she cries - it's like someone is slowly pulling out my fingernails one at a time. No joke. Tell me there is a magic trick I just haven't been let in on that will make evenings happy and calm again? Yes? Ok shoot👍🏼😇🙃🎈 @loving.lealuna #motherhood",

        "description": "I have lived in Aruba for over 7 years. Before that, Costa Rica for almost 3. I've been living away from my family for close to a decade; more than a third of my life, and it's always been ok. I go to Sweden a few times a year and they visit a ton and in between there is FaceTime and Skype and it works. \nLiving far away has never, not once, been a challenge. Up until now. Lea Luna is here and all of a sudden I don't know how to live without my mom. I literally don't know how we are going to function 5,000 miles apart. \nOur relationship has always been so intense and beautiful and messy and complicated and full of pain and love and there were times when I needed to be far, far away. Part of why I left home in the first place was because I needed space - we were always so close I never knew where she ended and where I began. Her pain became mine and at times it was too much for me to bare. I left because... I had to become my own person. And now it's been 10 years and we've done more work than I knew possible. Two years ago things took a turn for the worse and I thought we took a huge step back but I see now: we were actually moving forward. There are no mistakes. Nothing is random. We made it through and I'm not scared that she is going to die anymore. I don't have to worry about her happiness because now, for the first time, I know she does. And five weeks ago baby angel was born and literally catapulted us into absolute unconditional love. We are a family again. Or, we've always been, but for the first time since I was little I feel it in my bones. We belong together. Luna affirms it. This tiny little creature... She has changed everything. She has healed everything. She arrived and all of a sudden, everything makes sense and where there were wounds before now there is only love. \nMy mom just got on a plane and I'm crying like I'm grieving - it hurts like grief. I don't want to be apart anymore. Lea Luna wants us close. So I guess the question is... What now? \n#family",

        "description": "Beach babies!☀️🌴🌸 Yesterday was a fun, busy day. Lea Luna's first time with her feet in the sand! She is so happy. So beautiful. I love our little moon. It's all just too much! Her chubby little thighs and those big, blue eyes. Sometimes I feel like I want to eat her (is that normal?)🙈 The love is overpowering. \nShe is so alert now. Looks at us intently and waves her arms around, reaching out, trying to grab the world with her tiny little fingers. She slept on her own last night for the first time ever! Ok, not on her own, but it was the first night she didn't sleep in my arms or on top of me but in the co-sleeper attached to our bed (I may have slept with my head in there, I admit). It was literally the first time in a whole month that I wasn't skin-to-skin with her all night holding her... And it was my worst night of sleep by far. I was semi awake the whole time making sure she was breathing. Am I abnormally nervous? Or standard behavior for a new mom? She slept 11pm-3am and 3.30am-7.30am, breathing soundly the whole time☺️ Little shark baby! \nToday we are taking a little break and letting the rest of the gang go sailing - Luna is too little to spend the day on a boat so we are resting on the couch. Everything is peaceful. Love abound. xo #lealuna #happiness #motherhood #powerfulpureandsimple",

Wearing actual clothes! And yesterday I had a little glass of wine (shh don't tell)😋 I'm loving wearing @loving.lealuna throughout the day but it's literally like having a tiny oven strapped to your chest. In the Caribbean! She's being a rockstar hanging out with the @lovephilosophy crew though💪🏼 Tomorrow we are taking the #powerfulpureandsimple movement over to @island.yoga ! Follow along on IG stories for more. Happy Friday everyone!💛",

The highlight of the trip was shooting a friends wedding. I've never shot a wedding before but it was a lot of fun and everything turned out great. Pouncey is doing great and really missed me he's being extra cuddly and won't let me out of his sight.",

        "description": "Thanks to those that tuned in for the live feed. This is the photo I edited during it. I use Capture One to develop my RAW files like this photo. Just about everyone else in the world uses Adobe Lightroom as their RAW editor. RAW is an undeveloped digital negative and needs to be processed, developed and converted to .jpeg before it can be shared. If you're just shooting .jpegs like you would with your phone and most do with their cameras here's a trick. There's a free version of Capture One for Sony. It will handle Sony RAW files or Jpeg, TIFF, DNG. So if you want to use a professional editing software for your cell phone photos, the same software I use. You can download the Free Version for Sony and edit jpegs from any camera or convert RAW files from Canon/Nikon to DNG/TIFF and edit them. I prefer Capture One to Lightroom but it's expensive if you want to edit Canon/Nikon RAW files directly but if you shoot Sony the full pro version is only $50. I still recommend Lightroom to new users as there's just so many more people using it. You can find tutorials on YouTube, share presets and just about any photographer you talk to uses LR. So you're kind of on your own learning C1, there's videos on YouTube but nothing like the support for LR.",

        "description": "уроки ОБЖ (интересно существуют сейчас такие в школе?) у нас были раз в неделю и зачем-то в послеобеденное время. Проводились в нашем классном кабинете, в единственном котором я сидела за передней партой😅 с ещё двумя одноклассницами-подружками) не потому что места мало было в классе, а потому что мы дружили и нам разрешали) Но пост не про это) У преподавателя была ужасно большая и густая борода💂🏻‍♀️ и вот представьте, в этой бороде всегда были остатки пищи😭 морковь, хлебные крошки, зелень😫😭😅 в восьмом классе это вызывало только смех, тем более когда ты в полуметре от этого обеденного склада🙈 Я все думала ну зачем эта борода людям нужна🤷🏻‍♀️ А потом не понимала свою тётю, которая с удовольствием целовалась с усатым мужем😅😆 Я все не понимала как это прикасаться к такой волосатости лицом😆\nА сейчас, просто обожаю и щетину и бороду🙄😍 кайфую больше Димы😅 не даю сбривать) разве что вот так, немножко поправить) такая взрослость в этом, брутальность. Нравится очень😍",

        "description": "Когда дурная голова ногам покоя не даёт😭😅Рассказать как это?\nВ четверг я брала у Димы машину с документами, а в пятницу утром, когда он уже выехал из гаража вспомнила, что не отдала ему свидетельство о регистрации, или как там называется главный документ на машину, такой ламинированный розовый, пишу ему в вотсап, что готова сбросить в окошко, если он очень торопится. Беру первый попавший полиэтиленовый белый пакет, кладу документ на машину, мягкую игрушку для веса, завязываю потуже и бросаю)\nМеня очень редко останавливает дпс на дороге. Всего два случая помню: в первом машина была настолько грязная, что не было видно даже номер,  а второй раз с выключенными фарами ехала. Заботливые👮🏻👏🏻 А сегодня вроде и машина чистая и фары включены, останавливают. Ну почему я всегда их боюсь, даже когда ничего не нарушаю🤷🏻‍♀️ Вот только вдруг понимаю, что опять документа нет с собой😐, вспоминаю про пакет, ищу в салоне со скоростью света- не нахожу🤷🏻‍♀️, выхожу из машины и иду к багажнику, мимо сотрудника дпс😂, открываю багажник, говорю ребёнок игрушку просит😭 Про себя думаю вот сейчас найду пакет, достану игрушку и вуаля документ👌🏼В багажнике есть все, начиная с горшка, коляски, заканчивая старыми визитками, вешалками, лопатами, кроссовками, все что угодно, но пакета нет😐 стою, перебираю с места на место с уверенным видом😅Терпеливому сотруднику дпс это надоедает, спрашивает на всякий случай все ли у меня есть🙈😂 А я с таким уверенным и серьёзным лицом говорю, что документы то точно есть, вот игрушка где🤷🏻‍♀️😭😅 Тот разворачивается и уходит😳🙌🏼.\nА в пятницу Дима машину сдал на мойку,  а у них оказывается правило- раз лежит на полу (в ногах) значит на выброс😐😨. Поэтому они взяли и выбросили😰. Не спрашивайте почему пакет лежал там, и почему он документ не вытащил оттуда, и почему я как нормальная жена не вынесла его😭\nЯ потом ехала обратно с малышами домой, чувствовала себя каким-то жутким хулиганом без документов на машину) Ну вот как так😭 Потерять так глупо🤷🏻‍♀️ А фото ещё с мероприятия в марте в честь открытия флагманского магазина Hugo Boss в гуме. Фотограф нас так аккуратно просил двигаться для кадра, теперь я понимаю, что просто ловил голову Димы в надписи Boss😅",

Чтобы бродить по нью-йорку, останавливаться в придорожных отелях, перекусывать в маленьких городах, вспоминать фильмы про техас и просто влюбиться в новое место на нашем глобусе🌍\nМама когда гостила у нас сделала справедливое замечание, что такие воспоминания надо обязательно распечатывать, делать книги путешествий и дарить их ей😂 Так и буду делать👏🏻 Потому что @enjoybookru идеально передают качество самой обычной мобильной фотографии в печати😍 Имеют очень удобный конструктор, красивую обложку, стильное оформление и за один день привезли мне эту готовую нашу собственную книжку про остров Бали. \nКстати, как правильно балИ или бАли?) мне второе как-то слух режет)\nДелайте ваши личные книги, про свадьбу, про дни рождения, про путешествия, про детство, ну не заменить это чувство электронной фотографией🤷🏻‍♀️❤ Особенно для детей)",

        "description": "А это в лесу нашем, рядом с домом. Почти непроходимый и все равно столько пакетов валяется :( С годами и с появлением детей невольно становишься внимательнее к окружающей среде. Мне кажется я так часто пишу об этом в последнее время🤦🏼‍♀️ Рассказала сегодня Насте на примере наших бутылочек и тюбиков  из новой линейки Aura Botanica от Kerastase как они берегут природу и что изготовлены из старых пластиковых бутылочек 👏🏻\nИ вот мы коллекционируем теперь пластиковую тару😅 Настя решила собирать пустые бутылочки дома, чтобы сдать их потом на переработку :) Кто-нибудь может знает где их принимают? Коллекция-то растёт! :) А мне ещё любопытно посмотреть на коллекцию одного бренда (пока нет в продаже) с туфельками и аксессуарами из переработанного  пластика, стекла и полиэстера👏🏻 Это совсем мало, конечно, для сохранения природы, но хоть что-то. Дети впитывают все, как губка. Особенно Федя. Расскажу как-нибудь как он себя на уроках по английскому дома ведёт и какие потом фразы выдаёт😅 #любимприроду #экология #AuraBotanica, #KerastaseRussia #АмбассадорKerastase",

        "description": "Смотрите какая прелесть у нас появилась📘💓 Я уже не помню откуда у малышей эта симпатия к книгам, но ведь искренне радуются. Я уверена, что детские книги не обязательно должны быть с глубоким смыслом, и если это даже просто яркие иллюстрации, 3д аппликации, книжки-пищалки, но просто в формате книжки это уже начало симпатии к ней💓\nА это удивительная история, именная книга для Феди и Насти. Спасибо ребятам @mynamebookru за такие книжки🙌🏼 Добрая история про мальчика и девочку, которые потеряли своё Имя и ищут складывая по буквам. Помогают всем кого встречают на пути и получают помощь от них. Очень яркая и красивая, и легко читается.\nЯ бы точно рекомендовала такую книжку в подарок, если вы вдруг в поиске для племянников, маленьких родственников, друзей и своих детей, конечно😊 Я даже сохраню их обязательно, чтобы когда-то совсем не скоро они читали эти книжки своим малышам❤ Чтобы фантазировали, рисовали истории и рассказывали как искали маленьких Настю и Федю. Все мы радуемся таким мелочам из детства✨",

        "description": "Только спустя время, и вложив много сил и денег, мы поняли, что упустили очень важную вещь в ремонте - шумоизоляция. Ну жили же раньше в старой квартире и нормально, везде соседи разные, разных возрастов и с разными громкими передачами по телевизору вечерами. Но сейчас🤦🏼‍♀️ Пока мы путешествовали на Бали через стенку заселились соседи, молодая пара. Может их планировка как-то удивительным образом доносит до нас звуки, но... мы слышим абсолютно все😭 Мне кажется я даже их будильник пять дней в неделю слышу😩 Как моют посуду, смывают туалет, обсуждают вечером что-то. Иногда прям отчётливо каждое слово😭 Но самая большая слышимость ночью😅🤦🏼‍♀️ Это смешно и забавно немного, подруга даже в шутку прислала мне объявление, которое кто-то там в подъезде повесил по такому же поводу из-за шумного секса. Ну не вешать же такое же😂 Мы пересекаемся в лифте иногда, улыбаемся друг другу) Я вот думаю, может ли быть такая слышимость только односторонней, ну например мы их слышим, а они нас нет), и слышат ли нас также соседи за другой стенкой😐🤔",

        "description": "I've already made solid headway on my spring cleaning around the house, but now I need to spring clean my soul. I'm ready to make some changes. 🙌🏻\n.\nWe can all choose how we want to spend our time, and I've taken stock and found 4 habits that I am making a point to spend less time on from here on out:\n.\n1. I will avoid watching TV during the day.\n2. I will avoid negative conversations about other people, unless they are in a problem solving context.\n3. I will be less reactive to uncomfortable feelings of fear, anger, and sadness.\n4. I will avoid making assumptions about others feelings, opinions, and intentions.\n.\nIn the mission of improving oneself and breaking bad habits, I find it better to add than simply subtract. In place of my old habits I will be doing these things instead:\n.\n1. Spend more time outside.\n2. Spend more time discussing what I love and admire about people I know.\n3. Take more deep breaths and force myself to experience a waiting period before I react.\n4. Communicate when I don't understand someone's behavior, and ask them to clarify.\n.\nThese changes won't necessarily be easy, and won't happen overnight, but I'm determined to be a happier, calmer, less stressed, and more discipline me.\n.\nIf you were to spring clean your soul, what are some changes that you would make? 💗\n.\n.\n.\n📸: @the.walshman",

It's definitely NOT easy (at all), now that I'm a little older and less flexible... in fact, getting into this one took longer than I'd like to admit 😂... but I choose to let moments like this one remind me of something very important: I've still got it! 😉\n.\nMy head no longer touches the back of my standing leg (it's true), and I may be less flexible and more jiggly in some areas than my teenage self (such is life), but I'm also stronger, wiser, more sure of myself than teenage me ever could have imagined feeling, and... bonus... I finally grew the boobs that teenage me always wanted. 😂\n.\nComparing yourself to a younger you can be depressing if you let it, or it can be reaffirming and kind of awesome. It's all about where you choose to place your focus. ✌🏻\n.\n.\n.\nRocking: @aloyoga 😍\n#yoga #aloyoga #flexibility #backbend #splits",

        "description": "How easily are you offended? When you feel offended, what do you do about it?\n.\nI ask these questions, because as a society, I feel like we're becoming a little too touchy.\n.\nThat's not to say there isn't a ton of offensive stuff going on everyday, because it's all undeniably there, but at the same time it seems that some have started to welcome that feeling of offense, and the temptation towards self-righteousness that often accompanies it.\n.\nI feel like as soon as we combine self-righteousness with a feeling of offense, it becomes dangerous. In this case we run the risk of allowing ourselves to become offended more often, because when we become offended we also get to feel \"right\".\n.\nFeeling \"right\" does feel good. I get it. However this craving to be \"right\" is making a lot of us too quick to point out how others are wrong whenever we get the chance.\n.\nIf we continue this way, does being offended not become like crying wolf?\n.\nInstead of being offended by every little thing that we take personally, can we please take a step back, and save our offense and righteous indignation for situations where it really matters? Each of us must self-regulate, and honestly be our own judge of when this is the case, and when it isn't.\n.\nBeing so easily offended by everything around us doesn't bring us together. It polarizes us, it separates us, it makes us right vs. wrong, it makes us angry, it makes us fight, and it makes us, as a population, easier to control. (Ever heard the phrase \"divide and conquer\"??)\n.\nI'm all about social justice and righteous indignation (keyword: righteous, not superfluous), but otherwise, can we please chill out?\n.\nIf you're truly offended about something, then do something about it. Take action, don't just complain. If you're just taking things too personally, instead take a deep breath and try to take things with a grain of salt today. 😉💗\n-\n📸: @iliscrub",

        "description": "Happy birthday Neila! 🐶💗👑🎂\nThis little lover has been my partner in crime and best friend in the world for the last 13 years.\nWe've lived together in Michigan, Arizona, Texas, France, and California.\nNeila has been there to celebrate the happiest times, and also to cuddle with me when life brings tears instead.\nShe has watched me make some crazy (and sometimes even wrong) decisions, but she's never judged me, and she's stuck with me through them all.\nShe's lived with me in run-down apartments with each wall a different color, in mansions on mountaintops, and places in between.\nWherever we find ourselves, she always has a way of reminding me that it's not about where you live, or what you have, but about who you live there with and what you do.\nYou could even say she's saved my life a few times, and it wouldn't be an exaggeration.\nThank you for making my life so much happier, and bringing your unique brand of wisdom and positivity to my life and my community. I love you Neila! 💗",

At first I'm mildly resentful (I like my comfort zone!), and even scared, but then Jon talks me through it, we nail the pose (like he knew we would), and I always end up feeling surprised, stronger, and so grateful.\n.\nMoments like this one remind me that these are the type of friends I must surround myself with. The friends who lift me up, encourage me, support me, see who I truly am, and remind me that I am capable of so much more than I often even realize.\n.\nTAG a friend who makes you feel loved, supported, and strong. 💗\n.\n.\n.\nWearing: @aloyoga at @fslosangeles #fswellness",

        "description": "It's been a while since I've shared a progress photo. I came across the photo on the left of eka pada viparita dandasana recently and wanted to share the differences from then and now. First and most importantly, this isn't about what I was doing wrong in 2014 as much as this is about how my body has changed since then, allowing deeper range of motion. On the left, my elbows aren't yet under my shoulders. Since then, I've gained range of motion in my shoulders and am able to find the joint stack. I'm pressing my shoulder blades onto my back ribs to draw my chest forward, creating more space for my low back to lengthen. My leg isn't extended quite as high. This could be due to more flexibility in my hamstrings and more strength in my hip flexor. My foot is flat on the left and my hands are about a foot distance from my foot. I'm high on the ball of my foot on the right, grabbing my foot with my hands. Coming up onto the ball of my foot creates spaces for my low back to lengthen, which allows me to tighten my wheel without risking intense low back compression. These changes in my body didn't happen over night, there was no pill or tea involved 😜. It's a patience game, shifts can be very slow when done safely. It's been so fun sharing my journey with this virtual world 🌎❤️ My leggings on the right are by @myinnerfire from their newest Gypsea collection. Happy Sunday IG! .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#yoga #progress #transformation #healthylife #healthyliving #fitness #instafit #fitnessmotivation #inspiration #growth #change #dedication #motivation #balance #breathe #flexible #stretch #backend",

        "description": "It's day 11 already for #TwistOutTheToxins tomorrow! The pose is \"grasshopper prep\" or parivrtta utkatasana (revolved chair) variation. Not only is this pose a deep, detoxing twist, but a great hip opener as well. ❤ Beginning in utkasana (fierce pose, but for the sake of this description, I'll refer to it as chair pose), you'll want to sit deep in your chair pose. Toes light, four corners of the feet rooting down, knees together. Move into a one-legged char or figure four shape by crossing an ankle over the opposite knee. Line of the outer edge of the top foot with your thigh. As you stay deep in your chair, inhale to lengthen your spine and exhale to twist. (If your right foot is on top, you'll twist to the left) From here, you'll connect the sole of your top foot to the same arm tricep (Right foot, right arm). If this connection isn't happening right now, keep hands in prayer and work the twist without the connection. Remember - this is a path! Stop anywhere along the way. If the connection is made, inhale the arms open. If your bottom hand reaches the floor, use finger tips to aid in stability and lengthening the spine. A block is helpful here as well. I'm challenging my balance a bit more by grabbing my bottom foot with my hand. Taking the gaze up will further add to the balance challenge! Work to keep hips square and stack shoulders. Don't forget to breathe! Check in with @karlatafra tomorrow evening for our last day, day 12. Big thanks to the rest of the crew - @pocketdwarf and @rebeccaleann_ and sponsor @yoga_democracy. I'm wearing the Damask Me Again leggings from the @robinmartinyoga collection. 💙😊Thanks so much for coming to class and snapping this for me after @caseybrevigphotography - and for the shelter from the storm! 😘🙏🏻 .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#yoga #balance #breathe #twist #fitness #fitnessmotivation #fitfashion #stretch #strong #lines #angles #flexible #challenge #yogachallenge #healthylife #healthyliving #instayoga #igyoga",

        "description": "Tomorrow's pose, day 7, for #TwistOutTheToxins is ardha matsyendrasana - Half Lord of the Fishes pose or seated spinal twist. ❤️ Start seated, draw your knees up towards your torso, then slide your right foot (or left, but for the sake of this description, we'll go with right) under your left leg to the outside of your left hip. Step the left foot over the right leg and plant your foot on the floor. The left knee will point straight up. Take your left hand behind your back, lengthen the arm and use the palm or fingertips to help lengthen spine. Place your right upper arm on the outside of your left thigh near the knee. Draw your front torso and inner left thigh together - beginning to twist the torso away from your legs, twisting open to the left. Try to keep the shoulders in one line. Press the inner left foot into the floor and lengthen the front body. Lean the upper torso back slightly while lengthening the tailbone into the floor. With every inhalation lift through the chest, pushing the fingertips against the floor to lengthen the spine. Twist a little more with every exhale breath. ❤️ Intensify with a bind! Check in with @karlatafra tomorrow evening for day 8. Big thanks to the rest of the crew - @pocketdwarf and @rebeccaleann_ and sponsor @yoga_democracy. I'm wearing the Robin's Roses leggings from the @robinmartinyoga collection. 🌹😊❤️📷 by the beautiful @karlatafra 😘🙏🏻 #twist #challenge #balance #fitness #breathe #blackandwhitephotography #blackandwhite #bnw #bnw_captures #strong #stretch #igyoga #igfitness #instafit #rose #fitfashion #healthylife #healthyliving #yoga #yogachallenge",

Maybe one day hand flat on the floor? If it happens, it happens. If not, that's fine too.

        "description": "Parivrtta Navasana or revolved boat pose for day 3 (tomorrow) of #TwistOutTheToxins! 💗This pose offers all the benefits of navasana with the added twist! To move into this one, start by setting up navasana (boat pose). Sit on the floor or ground with your legs out in front of you, hands just behind the hips, fingers pointing toward the feet. Press through the palms to lift the sternum and lengthen the spine (try to avoid rounding the spine). Lean back slightly, and find balance on sit bones and tailbone. Begin to lift your feet, bend your knees and draw your knees toward your chest. For the sake of this explanation, take your left ankle and cross it under your right ankle. With the knees bent, reach your left hand across and take the big toe of your left foot with your first and middle fingers. As you work to straighten your legs, begin to reach your right arm back. Inhale to lift long through the spine, exhale to twist open to the right. Gaze to the right to challenge the balance. Keep hands grounded and knees bent (even toes on the floor, if needed) and twist open to modify. Check in with @karlatafra tomorrow evening for day 4. Big thanks to the rest of the crew - @pocketdwarf and @rebeccaleann_ and sponsor @yoga_democracy. I'm wearing the Artizen leggings from the @robinmartinyoga collection. Use TWIST20 for 20% off at @yoga_democracy. ❤️ Thank you for this capture, @apearlst 😊🙏🏻 #challenge #balance #fitness #yoga #breathe #balance #healthylife #healthyliving #yogachallenge #stretch #strong #fitness #pnw #pacificnorthwest #seattle #spring",

He put me on my first podcast and exposed me and @eatfamous to a whole new world of people. He allowed me to help promote New YorkCity Burger week all the way from Toronto. He also made sure that when I was in NY I met just about everyone in the food scene who matter and organized the most epic food crawl I've been on all in honour of my trip. Furthermore he's a great dude with a passion for food and one of my favs on or off the gram. So yeah, here's a shoutout to my buddy @revciancio and check out this pick of these Pig Style Fries from @grinderz that he took!!",

Кстати, всем кто собирается в Венецию, очень рекомендую посетить это восхитительное место!!! На фото я с шефом ресторана Руджеро Бово ( который недавно получил звезду мишлен) и с потрясающим гидом, который про Венецию и Ее округи знает ВСЕ (и даже больше!!!! )Если вы не хотите просто бездумно бродить, а узнать много интересного, нового и то, что другие туристы никогда не увидят, то очень рекомендую Валеру( @valerio71.venezia ) поверьте, ваша встреча с этим человеком вам запомнится надолго и вы не захотите уезжать)))) всем хороших выходных, а я на работу))))))) чао",

Как же я люблю быть дома, когда я знаю, что вкусный кофе, мой ритм, друзья приезжают , все улыбаются( но мне так кажется) я очень довольна. Любите свой дом, и себя любите. Кстати, про любовь к себе!!!! Это очень важно! Важно давать себе то, что хочешь, не только отдавать. Баловать себя и прислушиваться к тому что именно ВЫ хотите. Так часто мы забываем про это, а время проходит и мы все отдаём, с потом сами пустые и не частные. Полюбите себя прямо с сегодняшнего дня и вот увидите, многое изменится!!!!!",

        "description": "👒È arrivato il periodo dell'anno in cui ogni scusa è buona per stare un po' al sole. Io oggi mi sono goduta la pausa dallo studio in giardino, al sole, 🌅in compagnia di una bella rivista, di un buon caffè e della mia protezione AMBRE SOLAIRE SPRAY IP 50+ ! Voi proteggete la vostra pelle anche in città? La protezione solare non deve essere limitata all'estate, in spiaggia o in piscina. Le temperature fredde e il cielo nuvoloso fanno dimenticare facilmente che troppo sole, se vi si rimane esposti molto a lungo, può far male indipendentemente dalla stagione. AMBRE SOLAIRE SPRAY IP 50+ della @garnieritalia è portabile, facilissimo da applicare, non unge (perfetto per chi usa il makeup) e super protettivo dai raggi UV! Ottimo per chi gira in città e vuole proteggere la propria pelle! E voi l'avete mai sperimentato? Fatemi sapere!🔥\n-\n#EspertiDelSole #DailyUrbanProtection #GarnierItalia",

The wetland was excavated into network of fields and canals long ago, but now the locals make more money from #agrotourism every April than they do from the oil rich seeds that are pressed for cooking oil, or the taro that grows in the summer.  The farmer who put me up slept in his car this last weekend to have one more room to rent!  On #onassignment yesterday for @natgeo",

        "description": "Photograph by George Steinmetz @geosteinmetz  This is Leonard Knight, a visionary outsider artist that I met in 1988 during a trip through the Southern California desert.  Leonard was using discarded house paints to color Salvation Mountain, a monumental bas-relief earth sculpture, and was living in the dead truck you see in the background. On this day someone had just donated a scooter to him to transport water from a nearby irrigation canal to mix with the mud and straw for his adobe monument to God.  Leonard taught me the value of sticking with an idea, even if it was a little whacky, as over time it could develop into something substantial.  That fixity of purpose has informed everything I’ve done since: from my 15 year project to photograph all of the world's deserts, to my current @FeedThePlanet project to document the effect of large scale agriculture on the natural world.  To see what Leonard’s work became, check out #LeonardKnight which will lead you to the work of my friend Aaron Huey @argonautphoto, who did an entire book about Leonard in his last years. Leonard’s spirit lives on!",

What an incredible sanctuary we have been given, for our minds, bodies and souls. Climate change is very real, so be informed, thoughtful, and pro-active and let's protect her at all costs. A belated post because I was in transit but Happy Earth Day, today and every day! 🍃🌎🌿👣💫💕",

        "description": "Up the stream and across the bridge, is a big old tree standing tall in the middle of a green field. I pass it almost every day on my way to Shaftesbury, the biggest nearby town. Early this week I had the pleasure of creating a two day private workshop for the wonderfully talented photographer @lizbanfield We explored the world of photography, wandered through ancient castle ruins talking about the grand old masters in painting and sculpture and how they approached light and composition. After having done a baking shoot in a wonky old Tudor tea house, we swung by the local cheese monger filled our basket with the necessary ingredients for a picnic and journeyed on to my favorite tree. The cool Spring air blew hard, and we nestled up by its roots in the shade of the wind and talked about the future of photography as we nibbled away and uncorked a bottle of a full bodied red. I think there's adventure ahead, I said to her as I popped a warm grape in my mouth and smiled, and we agreed with a nod. I recently read in a magazine tear out my mother sent me attached with her weekly letter. It read; 'If you want something you've never had, you must be prepared to do something you've never done...' We finished our picnic in silence as we packed up our cozy little world, and I think we both felt the wind change... #adventuresahead #mmforsbergworkshop #myenglishcountryside",

Mr Whiskey is vigorously devouring his marrow bone from the local butcher in Tisbury, and I'm leafing through my new favorite magazine @luncheonmagazine that I bought in @10corsocomo Milano last week, and opening a package with a recent purchase from the loveliest vintage home ware shop @looptheloopuk (see story on Instagram stories in my profile) I love copper and couldn't be more happy with my new bottle opener and scissor set. Downstairs the kettle is whistling and upstairs my dress for tonight's dinner with darling @belleannee and her husband is ironed and ready for a night in Bath. It felt good to just be today. Little to no agenda, lunch in a pub and dinner in the city, wanders in the fields with the pooch, letter writing on my favorite stationary...and a cheeky glass of my new favorite red wine from @babylonstoren ) #weekendfun #looptheloop",

        "description": "Sometimes I get it right, and sometime I get distracted at the very end of making my creamy Risotto Milanese. I run out of stock, and it ends up a bit dryer than I want it to be. Today was one of those days. The mountain of dirty dishes piled high above the sink, I'd forgotten to put the lid back on the oak smoked garlic so my whole kitchen was infused with this rather strong \"perfume\" . Catching up on work I'd forgotten to walk Mr Whiskey this morning and he loudly made sure I realized it was way passed our usual morning wander time, and the laundry baskets were overflowing. So I decided to just embrace it all, and ate my less than perfect risotto at the table by the window, agreed with myself to let the dirty dishes wait till the evening, and put the rest of the emails on hold while I took my rather unamused pooch for a walk. But this is life, our imperfectly perfect lives, where I get to enjoy a Champagne picnic under my favorite tree on a mere Wednesday, and wake up to a bit of prop and home chaos on a Friday. No day is alike. No day is perfect, but some days are definitely better than other days... #myenglishcountryside #whiskeyandmoi",

        "description": "One of my favorite trees down the street and across the river was the perfect destination when lovely @hverdagslykkelise came to photograph us for an upcoming story in Norwegian interior magazine @vakrehjemoginterior The warm Spring sun was battling it out with freezing winds as we went to \"my\" tree for a wee picnic yesterday. I put down old books in each tablecloth corner for it not to fly away, as we sat in the shade of the tree with afternoon tea treats and popped a bottle of Prosecco. Sheep were grassing nearby, and every now and then a train would pass under the nearby bridge. Happy, I asked...very, he replied...Read the story and get the recipes in our upcoming feature in @vakrehjemoginterior #myenglishcountryside #vakrehjemoginteriør #countrysidepicnic",

        "description": "It's all about the service isn't it. You can forgive poor decor, and every now and then below par food, but if the service fails, I'm not very likely to return. To me it's all about how they made you feel. Don't get me wrong, the quality of food is important, but the atmosphere created by the staff is essential to a dining experience. On my recent trip to Italy we wined and dined in some of my favorite restaurants, enjoying that old school kind of waitering, where everyone involved from seating you to bringing you the wine list, and ultimately serving you the anticipated food, has that unmistakable elegance that indicate they take pride in their job. It all ooze of hospitality from a bygone era. Italy does this so well. Dressed in traditional black and white, and with a quiet charm, I'm easily swayed when they suggest a wine to go with the dish I just ordered. Call me weaksauce, but when a charming Italian waiter, dressed to a tee and with his manners and elegance makes you feel like you're dining at the Ritz, suggest you have a Recioto Della Valpolicella instead of the lovely French red wine you were leaning towards, you forgive him for possibly promoting Italian wine over French, and simply say yes. And of course, when has a Recioto Della Valpolicella ever disappointed... #wheninitaly #veniceitaly #whatitalyis",

        "description": "Milano was like coming home, it always is. After living there as a fashion design student when I was 19, I've returned again and again. The city feels like my pocket, and even if it's ever evolving and ever so exciting to spot new restaurants and bars pop up, I have my favorites that I always visit when in town. Marchesi, in Via Santa Maria alla Porta 11, is a must for breakfast, however their newly opened sister pasticceria in Via Montenapoleone is chic and so brilliantly designed it's up there as well. We met up with the wonderful @milanosecrets there one morning and talked about the future. She's definitely the one to go to for city eatery advise and gave us lovely tips on dinner that night. Then there's Giacomo Caffe in Palazzo Reale next to the majestic Duomo, at the very heart of the city. I prefer to go there alone, having a cup of tea and listening to the buzz of fellow tea and coffee drinkers. It's their decor that had me at hello the first time I visited, and it still does, every time. Al Matarel feels like my mother's kitchen and serves the most delicious Risotto Milanese, which is again, a must. However on this last trip we were too large of a group and had sadly forgot to book, so we strolled the Naviglio area in the afternoon sun and dined at the charming Asso di Fiori. Milano is classic, yet young at heart, and is home to some of the most inspiring designers I know! One morning just as the Spring sun began to warm up the city I met up with the lovely @tamumcpherson and headed to @dimorestudio It was design week after all, and they didn't fail to create the most magical space and experience. With weary feet and full bellies, my Englishman and I fell asleep that night with the window open, listening to the city quiet down. Do you mind if we come back soon again, I asked, he just before he fell asleep. Not at all, he replied, and I could hear him smile as he closed his eyes and took my hand. #mmforsbergmilano",

        "description": "So there we stood overlooking Matera and talking about the future... I'm impulsive in so many things in life, spontaneous and ever curious. However when it comes to relationships I'm slow and cautious. I listen to the wind, observe, take notes, analyze, and withdraw as soon as there's any hint of anything that can threaten my safe world and my lovely little life with Mr Whiskey here in the English countryside. I listen to others advice, whether it's asked for or not and continue my note taking, hopefully I won't miss a thing, and can figure him out so there's no chance of hurt on the horizon. A silly habit of trying to protect myself and staying in my comfort zone. He on the other hand stands tall and steady. When I withdraw, he steps up. When I make mistakes, he shows me he's not going anywhere. When I say we simply can't because I'm afraid, he just holds me. And when I get quiet, protective of my safe world and my wee home, he gives me space and time, without letting go of that warm embrace around my heart. It's a leap of faith in the end, he says, and I know he's right. But when do you know when to leap and with whom! At what point do you let go and trust. As we hopped on and off trains, hungry, tired and thirsty checking in to new hotels on our trip through Italy, he would hold the door open, carry my bags and massage my weary feet at night. Every evening he says thank you. Thank you for this day with you, Marie, he whispers, and I nestle my body next to his, smiling and feeling safe. Perhaps I can't protect myself or my little home from wild storms and cold winds, but I can choose with whom to face it with, and I feel so incredibly lucky to be facing it all with him. Because in the end it is just a leap of faith, as it is with everything. In Milano I walked passed a wall where it was written in bold black paint, 'It's your comfort zone that kills you'... and I couldn't agree more. #leapoffaith #myenglishman @theo_maxfield",

The winds will be mild and warm the first week in September, perfect for afternoon strolls through this ancient hill top town. Ancient caves @sextantio will be your home away from home during our time together. You don't have to be an avid cook or photographer to attend our retreats, everything will be hands on catering to all levels. During our retreat in Matera in September, we'll have cooking and photography sessions, working on visual storytelling, post production and slowing down how we work. Both analogue and digital camera users are welcome, as we'll have teachers in both on location, and I cannot wait to tell you who will join us  sharing her awe inspiring knowledge for film photography, inspiring us with her visual storytelling talent and incredible photography work. We'll launch this Art, Food and Photography retreat within the next few days, however should you want to be put on the list, feel free to email us at workshop@mmforsberg.com #mmforsbergworkshop #matera",

There was a warm breeze at the top, that danced with my blue dress as we walked around taking in the majestic view of the city below. People seemed like ants, and the rooftops a sea of terra-cotta. We wanted to stay longer, but the sun was already beginning to dip its head on the horizon and it was time to kiss yet another Italian city goodbye. In the name of research we bough one more 'Cornetto con crema' and had a caffe d'orzo. I love that in Italy almost every bar will have caffe d'orzo, or roast barley coffee, giving everyone a lovely alternative to normal coffee, that after a few too many cups makes my heart race. With our newly purchased books and coffee in hand, we found our seats and watched Santa Maria train station disappear in the distance... #whatitalyis",

We gazed up at a window high up on a wall where the Medici family had a secret corridor going from one end of the city across the bridge and onto the other side. This city never stops intriguing. With the backdrop of ancient Florence we had cocktails to the soundtrack of modern Italy at The Fusion bar @lungarnocollection As the bells rang in a new day, we were still out, wandering its streets admiring its many sculptures at night, only lit up by a faint moon and modest street lights... #florence (Photo by my Englishman @theo_maxfield )",

It must have been luck we agreed. A gentle breeze greeted us as we disembarked the train and made our way to Hotel Continentale @lungarnocollection a room overlooking the famous 'Ponte Vecchio'. A street musician played a cheesy old ballad in the distance, yet we both felt a surge of blood rushing to the heart. I love this city, he proclaimed, as we stood there midway across that ancient bridge that connects both sides of Florence, with the river Arno running beneath. Apparently not even Hitler could resist it's charm, according to both legend and @tommyonweb who with his dear @julskitchen kindly walked the streets of Florence with us until the bell tower chimed at midnight. It's easy to fall in love with Florence, home to the powerful Medici family, and creative playground for the legendary Leonardo da Vinci. We weaved in and out of narrow cobblestones streets dotted with small family run trattorias and grand basilicas. We'll have to come back soon again, he said, as we finally took a seat at the ever charming hole in the wall 'La Mescita' for lunch, taking the time to indulge in a handful of homemade cantuccini's paired with an indulgent little glass of Vin Santo. Late for our train to Bergamo in the afternoon we darted off, blew a few kisses in the general direction of the Duomo, and ran as fast as our legs could carry between well dressed florentine men and women...See you soon again Florence! #checkthetraintimesbeforeyouhavevinsanto",

        "description": "I sank into the deep bathtub in the middle of the room, and surrounded by lit candles, my heartbeat slowed down. This trip has been nothing but restorative. Did you know we are sleeping in one of the oldest dwellings on earth, he informed me from the bed at the back of our cave. He was reading up on the Paleolithic time period, when our cave first open it's doors to the public. Wow, I replied, in lack of a better, perhaps more educated reply. In fact I was a bit stumped for words. I mean, when I first visited our local pub in England @compassessinn where good cider has been served for more than 600 years, I was in awe, so the best I could muster as a reply was indeed wow, learning that our grotto hotel @sextantino had cave rooms that was the oldest still inhabited of its kind in the world! That night, the night before we hopped back on the train that would take us from the south of Italy to the north, I took time to write in my journal. I wanted to capture this moment, to bottle our adventure in this incredible place, to write a page filled with words that would help me relive this day, should I one day leaf back and read the page dated 06.04.17. So I put pen to paper and wrote; This place is bloody marvelous... and signed my name... #stumpedforwords",

Yesterday the sun warmed our faces everywhere we went, and painted this hilltop town bright and light. However today, a few clouds had gathered above, transforming, what in sunlight looks like the loveliest shade of creamy sand, took on hues of grey and blue, and I was in my element. During breakfast the fireplace was lit and I wrapped my hands around that comforting cup of tea I said I would leave behind in England... I'm a woman of my word, but as a friend told me the other day, it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind so I simply smiled and sipped my tea... #perksofbeingawoman #matera See more on Instagram stories...",

        "description": "The sun was just peeking  over the hilltop town of magical Matera as we opened the big oak door to our @sextantio hotel room, and began the day. Skipping down a few steps and passing an olive tree, we sat down for breakfast. The night before, we had walked the streets below as the sun set and the moon emerged. Across the valley mountain goats still grazed, and the sound of their bells made us feel we were a thousand miles away. Is this place even real, he said as he carried my bags up the steps to our room holding a big iron key from a bygone era. I think we're inhaling ever so real magic, I replied. The door opened and a candlelit grotto emerged in front of our eyes, a home away from home. If you want to join us for our upcoming retreat in this gloriously magical spot, our list is nearly full, but do email us at workshop@mmforsberg and we'll send you more info shortly. #mmforsbergwotkshop (Photo by the Englishman @theo_maxfield )",

        "description": "My mother hand kneads her dough, just like her mother did. It takes longer and gives your mind time to roam as you stretch, pull and knead the dough until it's ready to rise. It's simple everyday meditation for my mother, and even if it can be quite mindful, in the end it also just yields a great result. I've tried to adjust my life to her dough kneading rhythm, to slow things down, to spend more time on things in life that feels rewarding in a real and heartfelt way. Lots had to change, and so ultimately my workshops and retreats have gone through a change. My mother and I began combining our efforts in cooking and photographing last year, and I cannot begin to tell you how lovely it is to have her by my side and to infuse a bit of home and heart into our retreats held in the English countryside. We will continue to work on these smaller more intimate retreats, hosted near my home in England, however for our next one...we'll head all the way south in Italy...to the most magical hilltop town, to a home away from home, located in ancient caves at the ever magical @sextantio For a peek into our next retreat head to Instagram stories and follow our journey there... #mmforsbergworkshop",

It almost doesn't matter which one, as they are all ever so majestic and ever so magical in their own right. Stand right there, he directed, and guided me over to a spot where heaven and earth met in one golden pillar of light. The church was perfumed with dying ashes of incense, and the air that filled it, was cool and refreshing. You need your quite moments don't you, he said as he took my hand, I do indeed I replied. As much as we both love the buzz of the city, I think we're country souls through and through. We filled our picnic basket with pecorino infused with a delightful aroma of truffles, a few slices of salami and a little bit of freshly made focaccia, hopped on the train towards Napoli, and kissed Rome goodbye...for now... #mmforsbergrome (Photo by the tall dark and handsome @theo_maxfield )",

We chatted like old friends, even if it was the very first time we'd actually met. After hugs and see you soon again, we strolled down to 'Nonna Vicenza' for a bit of Sicilian pastry heaven, land stocked up on ricotta filled cannelloni. Rome is warm these days, still chilly for locals, yet feels like summer for us. I packed light dresses and soft ballet flats, and he packed his blue shirts and suede summer-in-city shoes. We strolled, as you do, over ancient bridges, weaving in and out of narrow cobblestone alleyways, ending up I a sunny little corner, a stone throw from Piazza Navona, enjoying a simple homemade lasagna. Life feels easy, everything's on hold... #mmforsbergrome #caffegreco",

Sono molto orgoglioso di far parte di questa grande famiglia che si impegna a far del bene, perché ciò che facciamo solo per noi stessi muore con noi mentre ciò che facciamo per gli altri e per il mondo resta ed è immortale. E noi saremo sempre qui pronti a tendere una mano. @nhh_italia grazie per avermi accolto, è un onore far felici le persone insieme a voi! #nazionalehiphop",

I've been trying out the new @Jergensus Natural Glow Wet Skin Moisturizer and I love it because it’s really easy to use and it gives a natural-looking color. You apply this straight on your wet skin after you shower (sooo convenient) and dry as usual, so it's super easy to add to my daily routine. I usually use this for a couple days in a row and then go to every other day to maintain the color. They have 2 shades and I like the darker one! Have any of you tried this yet?! #JergensPartner",

For those of you who have been following my journey for years, you would remember our partnership in the gym to help Robbie get below the 90kg mark from 120kg and now, even in my absence, he is DOMINATING his goal and is sitting around 80kg. I learned so much from Robbie, as he did me and it was absolutely amazing to catch up with him and his mother Glenys yesterday. I had the biggest smile on my face the whole time, so did he. If you want to read about the story of Robbie & I just click this hashtag ➡️ #flexyourheartforrobbie 😊🙏",

This photo I brightened it and a tiny bit of saturation 😘",

To all the mummy's out here having a rough day, feeling exhausted , like they can't cope , wondering if they are the only ones feeling it let me tell you - YOURE NOT ALONE. Very normal to feel all of the above many times / kids teach us so much and constantly challenge us as parents and humans , our patience , understanding , compassion , learning skills and so much more. Take one day at a time , reach out for support when you need it and just know that every tantrum , challenge , long day will past. In saying that there is some long days but the years fly by and before you know it they have grown up! So try to enjoy as much of it as you can ( tantrums are fun said no mum ever ) BUT you know what I mean.\nAlso make sure you do a check in on social media and who your following , make sure it's people who empower you, inspire you and motivate you to step up in the world and be the happiest healthiest BEST version of yourself! Anyone else you aren't giving click unfollow ✌🏼 GO on do it!\n.\nSnapchat adventures for the weekend as we have lots of fun coming up : 👻 ashybines1\n.\nTAG A FELLOW MUMMY WHO MAY NEED THIS TODAY!",

        "description": "Flashback to that one day in 1998 when Anselme Baud and I skied the Western Ice Stream on the Vinson Massif in Antarctica. 🏔⛷❄️ Anselme is legend for his ski descents in the Mont Blanc Range. If jump turns on steep terrain in flannel shirts is your gig, check out the video (in link) of Anselme and Patrick Vallençant skiing the Arête de Peuterey back in the day.  Nice video. 👀\n\nWe were both guiding the the high point of the frozen continent and were waiting for the flight out. A thick ground fog had us grounded. Sensing the sky was clear above, we set out for a day of skiing. The main Ice Stream was calling. The ski descent was 2000 meters elevation change at a steady angle. For Anselme this was his birthday gift;  he turned 50 while on the Ice. It was, by his estimation, the longest continuous descent he had the joy of skiing. On a personal level, I was able to play with a \"ski extrem\" hero and explore the range. Anselme is a kind and generous soul. The day we skied will always be close to my heart. Thanks Anselme. #neverstopexploring @thenorthface",

Built a mini bee stand out of gneiss and stained the cedar box with tung oil. Our queen, workers and drones are on order from an apiary near Cedar City, Utah. Once the plants start blooming and the timing is right we will start the hive. 🌻🌼🌻 Our little pollinators are facing a tough go. Loss of habitat, climate change, insecticides and disease are all making bee survival a matter of global importance. One-third of of the food we consume has a connection to bees. Our goal is to help out plants in a 5 mile - 8 kilometer radius and nurture a batch of bees. Knowing that 40% of hives fail we are not taking this for granted. Challenges are good for the human spirit. 🌎🌍🌏 If you have dandelions in your yard please let them flourish. Bees benefit from these colorful plants. 🐝🐝🐝 Stay tuned for my bee line. 🤓",

There was nothing that made him happier than having me carry a pack on a hike as he progressed in age and I was finding my stride.  When he encouraged me to climb full time I had the confidence to seek a life of adventure. Thanks Wallers for the life lessons.

        "description": "VISION X BALANCE ✖➕✖\nWhen we idolize artists, musicians, actors, or any celebrities, we are appreciating the fact that they have achieved a life situation that is filled with things they love to do,  are publicly celebrated for it,and are paid to do it. We crave the same, yet we give ourselves excuses as to why it's not possible... I'm not talented, I don't have money, I don't have the looks... Or we get too caught up in the egoistic reasons for achieving something... Do you want to be an actor because you love to act? Or because you love the money and fame? Do you want to be an entrepreneur because you love to set goals, and achieve them no matter how big or small, or because you heard from your friend that CEOs of successful companies make over 6 figures? How will you feel when you don't get rich & famous doing something you don't really like ? Is that what life is really about? Find your passion , and live it. You will attract masses of people who will celebrate you for doing what you love, while inspiring them to do the same . #motivation #findyourpassion",

        "description": "Dear friends! Recently, at the invitation of our friends from Rüsselsheim we went to new Opel Insignia test drive in wonderful city of Frankfurt and surrounding area. Design of the car impressed me a lot. It's largely based on Monza concept presented in 2013. Design team headed by Mark Adams combined flowing lines and subtle surfaces with crisp, precise lines to even exaggerate the dramatic proportions. As the result the car looks longer, lower and wider than it actually is, and it definitely looks upscale. Every design feature conveys technical know-how and utmost precision!\n/\nДрузья, недавно по приглашению наших друзей из Рюссельсхайма мы отправились на тест драйв новейшего Opel Insignia в замечательный город Франкфурте и его окрестности. Несколько слов о машине. Дизайн кузова во многом базируется на представленном в 2013 году концепте Monza. Команде дизайнеров во главе с Марком Адамсом удалось реализовать в рамках Insignia множество инновационных решений. В автомобиле удивительным образом сочетаются плавные линии с утонченным силуэтом. Insignia выглядит длиннее, шире и ниже, чем есть на самом деле!\n•\n#Opel #Insignia #7in17 #design #frankfurt #germany #франкфурт #германия",

        "description": "Did you know that cats wag their tails when faced with a choice. It means that one desire is blocking another. For example, if the cat is in the doorway and wants to leave but it's raining on the street the tail will swing due to the internal conflict. The cat wants to go out but don't want to get wet. As soon as it decides whether to stay home or go out in the rain, the tail will immediately stop swinging!\n/\nДрузья, а вы знали, что кошки машут своими хвостами, когда стоят перед выбором, при этом одно желание блокирует другое. Например, если кошка стоит в дверном проеме, и хочет выйти, а на улице идёт дождь, хвост будет качаться из-за внутреннего конфликта. Кошка хочет выйти, но не хочет промокнуть. Как только она примет решение (остаться дома, или выйти под дождь), хвост немедленно прекратит раскачиваться!\n•\n#cat #catsofinstagram #cats #catstagram #catlover #catoftheday #catsagram #catlovers #catlove #cats_of_instagram #minimalistzen #mindtheminimal #vscominimal #ig_minimalshots #onlyminimal #minimal #minimalism #minimalist #miniature #minimalmood #bnw_society #bnw_demand #bnw_globe #bnw_city #bnw_diamond #bnw_universe #noir #noiretblanc #bnwmood #чернобелое",

I  admire Sophia's approach on how she answers in interviews and handles her success. She's not afraid to admit, she still doesn't always have her sh*! together. It's a great reminder to know that being flawed is okay, it's life. We don't have to be perfectly put together 24/7. Embrace the challenge right? #R29xGirlBossNetflix #instagood #instadaily #girlboss #style #girlbossnetflix",

And as much as I wanted to do it all properly, the idea of doing #allthethings to make a legit amazing font totally terrified me!!!!😜\nNow my friend Teela over at @everytuesday has just released an amazing online course that breaks down alllll the ins and outs of making a font, as well as selling it! I am super excited to work through the course myself, would love to have some of you join me.❤️\nHer course is only open for enrolment for five days, so if this is something you've been thinking of doing, get onto it quick!! Link is in my profile 👉🏼 @lissletters or go to bit.ly/fontmaking\n.\n.\n.\n(This is an affiliate link, which means I make money from any sale made from my link, but the price doesn't change for you. I would never recommend anything to you that I didn't wholeheartedly believe in)",

You don't have to have it all together, no one every actually does anyway - we're all a bit messy and complicated if we're honest.💜\nI've spent most of this morning staring at my computer blankly and trying to decide whether to persist or just crawl back in bed. As a mum who works from home, quiet moments are rare, and the struggle to decide whether to be productive or just lie on the floor and breathe in the silence is real. And while we're being honest, I'll probably do a bit of both today. But I also want to use my child free time to have adult conversations with other women in my life. Anyone else out there trying to cram 20 hours of productivity, some self care and social interaction into 5 hours of child free time??? 😄💜",

Bring your whole self to your whole calling - all of your passion, your anointing, your weirdness, your story, your mind and soul. The way you are made and your place in the world matters. One size doesn't fit all. Let the Holy Spirit lead you in boldness. You just might be surprised where you land. After all the number one place for women to flourish in their callings should be the body of Christ. We are better with you fully alive.\"",

        "description": "Quizás no logréis reconocerme en todas, pero soy yo. Soy yo en distintas versiones. Una yo que huye de fuera a dentro. A la que llamaban valiente sólo por cambiar de pelo cada semana y media sin miedo al desastre. Yo encerrada en mí, con las gafas de la tristeza puestas y un hermetismo tan grande que aún hoy escuece.\nLa vida cambia cuando dejas de contar fracasos para contar victorias, y también cuando dejas de tocarte el pelo para centrarte en aquello que no tienes el valor de afrontar.\n\nSólo quiero daros las gracias a todas las personas que estáis y habéis estado ahí siempre, acompañándome y observando el mundo en el reflejo de unas letras que no siempre me aliviaban. \nLo bonito de que pase el tiempo es que esta cuenta se ha convertido en un diario de superación y consuelo; y no sabéis lo feliz que soy cuando me contáis que os ha servido mínimamente para algo.\n\nCrecer es maravilloso, y tan bien acompañada es el doble de bonito. \nY no me da apuro ni miedo exponer todo esto porque sé que quizás estoy narrando algo que a mí me hubiera ayudado leer hace unos años.\n\nQue el tiempo siga sonando, que nosotros seguiremos bailando.\n\nGracias ❤",

Crecer ayudando a otros a destruir sus barreras y dejarles libres y grandes. No irrumpiendo, ni apocando. No señalando. No invadiendo.\nNo dejes que tu piel limite lo que tu alma grita. 🕉❤\nComo sabréis algunas, tengo escoliosis lumbar, y por tanto un desplazamiento lateral del cuerpo. Sólo tengo curva por un lado de la cintura, y cuando llega el verano soy mucho más consciente de ello. \nPor eso y por muchas cosas más, creo que deberíamos procurar evitar comentarios sobre delgadez o gordura, o sobre físico en general. Porque nunca sabemos qué hay detrás de cada cuerpo y dentro de cada cabecita. Hay batallas que no nos corresponde librar. 🕉💙 Mi yo de 15 años me mataría por subir una fotoespejo con una réflex 😂",
