      "description": "\"You will never have to force anything that's truly meant to be.\" 🌿 Just weeks before our trip to Maui, I connected with @ellenfisher on Instagram. I was so inspired by her natural lifestyle on Maui as well as her vegan food. After we arrived Maui, we messaged each other and hoped to meet up. But with our busy travel schedule and her house renovation, we couldn’t find a time that fits both of us. So we wished each other well and hope to meet somewhere else in the future. Then on one of our last days on Maui, we decided spontaneously to visit Iao Valley since we had 30 mins to spare before taking our helicopter ride. Just I walked around the area to take photos, I noticed a girl in the parking lot with beautiful blond hair and stunning figure, but I couldn’t see her face. As I passed by her, I looked at her again and realized it was Ellen!!! I couldn’t believe it! We introduced our families to each other and got to spend a brief time together. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 We love how she and Andrew decided to move to Maui for the wellbeing of the kids and for their commitment of the healthy lifestyle. It is truly inspiring. The little Elvis showed my kids how to swing in a banyan tree. And Sandy, OMG, I wish I could take him with me. He is just the cutes! So that’s the story how I meant to meet Ellen Fisher. Take a look at her account, watch her YouTube videos and give her a follow. She offers so many great tips on healthy eating as well as living. 🎬🌿",

      "description": "Just want to say \"Thank you\" to those who took the time to comment to my previous post yesterday! 🙏😊 It was absolutely fascinating to learn about you guys! We are all world citizens and living without borders! I love how social media connects people as well as inspires the way we live, cook, decorate and travel. It pushes us to try and do things that we couldn't have never thought of! (Sadly, there are also a lots of things I don't like about social media, hacking, privacy invasion, copyright infringements...) But I would like to focus on the good. Social media is a tool, which is up to us how we use it. For now, sending you sunny vibes from California and wish you a great weekend! ☀️😎🙌",
