The aquifer-fed Platte River is a roosting area for roughly 413,000 sandhill cranes as they migrate between northern Mexico and Siberia. This shot was taken as an evening storm rolled into the Nebraska plains just as the birds were beginning to land for the night. It was published in the August 2016 issue of National Geographic magazine. Purchase signed prints of this image for $100 from April 17th - April 22nd in honor of Earth Day.

      "description": "There are six great aquifers in the world. In North America our great aquifer is the Ogallala—it stretches from South Dakota to the Texas panhandle. Twenty percent of our food and 40 percent of our beef rely on the aquifer. It’s unfortunate that we’ve pumped the equivalent of two Lake Eries out, setting the stage for a new desert in the Texas panhandle and southern Kansas in the immediate future.\n\nThe aquifer recharges at different rates. Nebraska wins the water lottery; it is the only place you can see Ogallala water at the surface. The Ogallala takes a long time to recharge in Texas, where there are the most wells, the least regulation, the hottest temperatures (even before climate change), and the slowest recharge. Entire communities in this area are already running out of water.\n\nScarcity of water, fragile infrastructure, small dust bowls, the family farm crisis, Big Ag, and global urbanization leave some behind with few options. Small towns are disintegrating around their residents. There is rampant meth and opioid addiction in some of these places. If your hot water heater breaks, there isn’t anyone in your entire county that can fix it.\n\nI am from the Midwest, and the pain rural folks have gone through showed up this election. I saw this frustration first-hand working on the Ogallala aquifer story that ran in the August 2016 issue of National Geographic, but I never thought the level of frustration of these communities would manifest itself in this way. @natgeo @natgeocreative @thephotosociety",

They migrate from Siberia to northern Mexico. They counted 413,000 Sandhill Cranes on this evening… more than they’ve ever counted before.
