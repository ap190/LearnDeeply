I was having kind of a down week, but one of my friends had an extra pass for the last day of coachella. there's been a lot of things I haven't been able to do since breaking my wrist, physically and financially. thank god, shooting is something I've been able to manage. a couple months ago, I couldn't snap my fingers or clap my hands. I couldn't turn the ignition over to start my car, or turn the dial for the ac. fast forward to last night. I was dancing my heart out to jai wolf's set. then it hit me. hands in the air, I was snapping and clapping my hands to the beat. this moment made me so happy. it was a reminder of how much progress I've made. I'm still on the road to recovery, but I'm so thankful for the little things along the way. we all get knocked down, but it's our choice to either be defeated or get back up. I don't know about you... but when something breaks me, I'm going to get back up and I'm going to dance.",
