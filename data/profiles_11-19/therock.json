This doc is ridiculous. \nWhat’s also ridiculous is me devouring these gigantic MF’n cookies and bringing gluttony to a new level. \nEnjoy your cheat meals my friends. \nYou ain’t cheating if you ain’t eating ✊🏾",

Well, they’re just like my nickname after I drink tequila - Big, tasty & heavenly. \nI’ll go to hell for that one, but not before I take these cookies to pound town while watching the OG trailblazer himself, Quincy Jones’ doc on Netflix. \nLove it. I need to have tequila one day with this brilliant man. \nIf you ain’t cheatin’, then you ain’t eatin’ my friends. \nEnjoy!\n#SundayCheatMeal\n#HelloGluttony",
