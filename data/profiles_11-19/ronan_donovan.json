As the unprotected forests are cleared, wild animals are forced to look elsewhere for food. Since a taboo against consuming primates exists in Uganda, the chimpanzees remain in these tiny slivers of forests. After years of negative interactions with humans, chimpanzees have become aggressive towards people as the chimpanzees are forced to raid crops and wander past village homes.\nI'm currently in the field exploring stories similar to Teddy's.

As a result, they've begun to exploit the alternatives, which are fruiting trees planted by humans.\nPatrick (left) and Moses measure the circumference of a large fruiting mango tree located 50ft away from a village home. This tree is visited by wild chimpanzees who have adapted to essentially stealing fruit from these subsistence farmers. Patrick and Moses are adding to a data set of the changing foraging habits of a group of 22 wild chimpanzees.\nThis overlap between humans and chimpanzees can lead to a multitude of conflicts from disease transfers to physical attacks - both of which have been recorded. At current rates of deforestation, by 2025 all of these privately owned forests will be logged for timber and charcoal and cleared for agriculture.\nI'm exploring what this means for the people and the 300+ chimpanzees that are living side-by-side on private land. Their futures are both linked to these forests. \nWhat does coexistence look like? I'm hoping to find out. \n#NatGeo #uganda #africa #chimpanzee #conservation #greatape",

      "description": "Uganda for @natgeo // Intelligent eyes gaze down from the safety of the trees. This community of wild chimpanzees is wary of new human faces. They study me for 10 minutes, bobbing their heads up and down to take in as much information about me: my clothes, hat, backpack, camera and most importantly, my face. \nI'm at an advantage to other humans because I'm standing alongside a field assistant, named Tom Sabiiti, who has been working with these chimpanzees for close to 10 years. \nThey know him and trust him. And by association, I'm not seen as an immediate threat, but one still worth keeping an eye on.\n\nChimpanzee facial recognition is similar to ours in judging a familiar face or a strangers. This evolutionary trait served us well in our hunter gatherer days when making that split second judgment could result in serious injury or death - fiend or foe.\nWild chimpanzees still live under threat from both other chimpanzee communities as well as their closest relatives, humans. \nI'll be posting from the field for another month while I look at the future of chimpanzees living outside of protected areas in rural Uganda. \n#hoima #africa #uganda #chimpanzee #greatape #wildlife",

      "description": "Eric, with the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International (@savinggorillas), explains how mountain gorillas feed on eucalyptus trees outside the border of Volcanoes National Park in northern Rwanda. They begin by stripping the bark, then scraping their incisor teeth on the cambium of the tree to release the sweet sap. This is relatively new phenomenon, recorded only in the last 10 years around the park. \n#rwanda #mountaingorilla #gorilla",
