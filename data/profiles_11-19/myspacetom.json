      "description": "Someone reminded me today that several weeks ago I said I felt like I was having the most amazing time of my life--that every day was better than the day before. Today he asked me \"Was today the best day of your life so far?\" You know what? It probably was! My joy comes from the exploration of endless possibility and that I know I'm helping others. I truly helped someone today. There's no better feeling. Your life's path may not be obvious or predictable, you may not know where it leads, but I think you will know when you have found a path that is truly your own. üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ",

      "description": "The best sunrise I've ever witnessed!! When you spend all your time taking landscape photographs, you are truly dependent on nature. The weather dictates all.  For weather geeks, the conditions you‚Äôre looking for are somewhat predictable, but never certain. You learn to read the sky. You look and make educated guesses. You put yourself in the prime spot and wait. You‚Äôre prepared for that moment that is always singular, always unique. No two sunrises are ever the same. You hope for the best, and pray for serendipity. When Planet Earth is on your side, magic happens. Taking a good photograph begets joy & serenity in a meditative state. You become one with the universe, because the universe is on your side. Everything that was before this moment had to be, or this moment would not be. The cosmos are telling you, once and for all, that your place is in this world, and here is your reward. \nCheck the link in my bio: I just launched a blog where you can see the full photo uncropped: myspacetom.com",

This place was different for me. I was traveling through Taiwan with no real idea of what I might find. I got a rental car in the main city Taipei and just started driving. After a few days I‚Äôd entered the gorge by car, but later moved to hiking on foot. This was not a touristy or popular spot.  At least not in 2012 when this photo was taken. As I meandered along the mountain‚Äôs edge trail, pushing bushes out of the way to take in the view, I rounded a corner and saw this temple peering out from the fog. I felt a strange combination of excitement and serenity. I need more moments like this. :-)",
