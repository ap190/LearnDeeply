I don't know what Elfin magic he was on, but I'm pretty sure it included a fair portion of stoke, the universal elixir.\n\nShot at 300mm on the magic stability machine: @getolympus  e-m1 mark ii #capturingwhistler",

With the brush we pull forward detail and clarity, we enhance the subject of our opinion, we build as tho with clay. However, with a camera - and its powerfully indiscriminate clarity, we have to push or crop areas into obscurity, as tho carving to reveal our subjects from the marble of the world.
