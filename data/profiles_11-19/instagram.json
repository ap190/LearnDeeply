      "description": "Featured photo @rrrudya\nWeekend Hashtag Project: #WHPsquares\nThis weekend it‚Äôs time to think (in or) outside the box. The challenge is to make images and videos that play with variations on the square, as in this featured photo from Alina Rudya (@rrrudya).\nHere are some tips:\nStart with the shape. Find or create patterns using squares. A checkerboard floor, a tall building with a grid of shuttered windows, or even a random configuration of three-dimensional cubes could all be fun starting points for your submission.\nTry a new angle. Get creative with new perspectives. For example, place your subject in the corner of a square room and have them stretch out to fill the extremities of a life-sized square frame; set your friend atop of an oversized cube; or use a square frame within your image to draw attention to your desired point of focus.\nBe playful. Revisit your childhood for inspiration. Think of games like tic-tac-toe, hopscotch and chess that are all based around the square. Or go outside of the box and use your imagination! Build an environment out of colorful blocks, or turn a cardboard box into a rocket and have your pet go for ride. üöÄ\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPsquares hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. By adding the #WHPsquares hashtag, you consent to and grant Instagram all rights to repost your photo or video. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Our project takes inspiration from the Kering Foundation‚Äôs annual White Ribbon For Women campaign, which raises awareness of violence against women each November.\nHere are some tips to get inspired:\nFocus on your local community. Create images that show how your peers are standing up for one another and coming together.\nDocument kind interactions that show compassion like providing a shoulder for someone to lean on, or a group hug.\nFind ways to express positivity. Whether it‚Äôs capturing small acts of kindness, like a big smile between two friends, or seeking out props that symbolize peace, like the campaign‚Äôs white ribbon. Also consider other emblems that illustrate a sense of tranquility within your image or video.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPcommunity hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. By adding the #WHPcommunity hashtag, you consent to and grant Instagram all rights to repost your photo or video.

      "description": "Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPscale\nThis weekend, size matters. The challenge is to make images and videos that accentuate scale, like this photo illustration from Anastasia Kosh (@kosh_dp).\nHere are some tips to get started:\nMake images in places that naturally embody scale. Whether you're under the open sky, out on the ocean waves or in a redwood forest, look for opportunities to further accentuate scale by including small elements like a small figure or tiny cabin in your frame.\nFocus on the little details. An eye looking through a magnifying glass, a single leaf falling from a tree or even a tiny car at a busy intersection can bring attention to the smaller things in the world that often get overlooked.\nBe playful. Use things that are miniature or scale models of the real thing. Become a giant in a model village, hold a dollhouse in the palm of your hand, pluck a cotton wool cloud from the sky or play eye tricks to make unusual situations come to life.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPscale hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Here are some tips to get started:\nDream up a new character. You can transform into a fantastical creature, a beautiful apparition or even an optical illusion ‚Äî there are no limits.\nRely on props. A sheet can transform your little brother into a ghost, a broom can make your best friend a witch, or a classic toothy jack-o'-lantern can set a spooky mood. \nCreate a scene. Think about locations like a foggy forest or a dark room with dramatic lighting to add the desired atmosphere to your submission.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPdressup hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. By adding the #WHPdressup hashtag, you consent to and grant Instagram all rights to repost your photo or video.

      "description": "Featured photo by @lennart\n#Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPmirrorimage\nThis weekend, the goal is to take photos and make videos that play with reflections and mirror the world around us, as in this image from Lennart Pagel (@lennart).\nLook for reflections at different scales. Whether it‚Äôs a mountain peak reflected in the still waters of an epic landscape or a silhouette standing tall in a cafe window, mirror images can be seen and photographed in lots of different places. Keep your eyes peeled.\nThink about the light and mood. A sun-drenched landscape captured in a rearview mirror fuels a very different feeling than a still portrait framed by a vintage full-length mirror.\nPlay with perspective. Bring mirrors into nature to explore optical illusions or capture a warped or distorted image, or use multiple mirrors and reflections to create your own ‚Äúhall of mirrors,‚Äù a kaleidoscopic image with an infinity reflection.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmirrorimage hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. By adding the #WHPmirrorimage hashtag, you consent to and grant Instagram all rights to repost your photo or video. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video shared over the weekend with the #WHPmirrorimage hashtag is eligible for the project and, if selected, to be featured next week.",

Here are some tips:\nGo somewhere out of the box. Think about unusual places and situations, like underwater, in a hall of mirrors or the middle of a crowded party, to make your final product surprising.\nInclude distinctive details. Dress up or get creative with props, makeup or lighting to make your portrait more distinctive. Use colorful accessories, surround your eyes with flower petals or wear two pairs of overlapping sunglasses.\nGet creative within the frame. Play with hand or body positions to make your portrait pop. Get close up in someone‚Äôs smile, crop your portrait to see half a face in the frame or shoot from different directions and angles to create something unique.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPunusualportraits hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video shared over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.",

Liz shares moments from her daily life in Sydney, Australia, including everything from vegan recipes to self-care tips to ways to reduce plastic waste. ‚ÄúI like to think of my Instagram as evolving with me. It‚Äôs a journey of me becoming my best self.‚Äù\nIf Liz were to recommend one small change people make to their daily lives, it would be to make time for meditation. ‚ÄúMeditation has been transformative for me,‚Äù says Liz. ‚ÄúI think all health and happiness comes from within you. Just sit with yourself for 10 minutes a day, and you‚Äôll figure out who you are. You‚Äôll strengthen yourself from the inside.‚Äù\nLearn how Liz makes all-natural deodorant today on our story and watch how she makes vegan granola on our IGTV channel.

      "description": "Featured photo by @princejyesi\nWeekend Hashtag Project: #WHPmatching\nThis weekend, we‚Äôre seeing double. üëÄ The goal is to create photos and videos that show the power of a pair, as in this image by Prince Gyasi (@princejyesi). Here are some tips for the project:\nGet twinning. Whether you dress up friends identically or capture a mirror image of the moon on a lake, get creative with how the concept of ‚Äútwinning‚Äù can show up in photos and videos.\nConsider classic duos. Find objects that come together for your composition. Think of a knife and fork, cereal and milk, or even sticks and stones.\nMatch unlikely pairs. Go beyond identical images or classic duos by playing with the way people and objects relate. Take a photo of a friend in a green sweater enjoying a matcha ice-cream cone, or have a sibling stretch out in the same shape of your favorite backyard tree.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmatching hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video shared over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.",
